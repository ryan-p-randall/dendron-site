Like most such tools,  Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to make it) easy to **get notes in**, they tend to make it **hard to get them back out** later, and it only **gets worse as you add more notes**. Dendron helps you **get notes back out** and **works better** the **more notes you have**.\n\nI originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base. \n\nTraditional note-taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks. \n\nDendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting backlinks of any two arbitrary notes while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through our **[hierarchal first approach to note taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html)** that relies on the combination of [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]], [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]], and [[path based lookups|dendron.topic.lookup]]. \n\nWith Dendron, you can **create, find, and collaborate** on information that **matters to you**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/graph-intro.gif)\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWhether you organize your notes with [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) or [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), link notes together like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), or simply create notes in an ad-hoc manner, Dendron can help.\n\nThink of it as a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) to help you **make sense** of all the information you care about.\n\nSome popular use cases include:\n\n- project management \n- learning & academia\n- personal knowledge base \n- journaling of all forms\n- CRM to keep track of clients, friends and enemies\n- {Your Use Case Here}\n\n## Getting Started\n\n((ref:[[dendron.guides.install]]#Getting Started,1:#Install))\n\n## Onboarding\n\n[Kevin](https://kevinslin.com/), the founder of Dendron, does a personal onboarding with new users.

You can use this to quickly create bulleted checkboxes. \n\n## Interactive Checkboxes\n\nMarkdown preview renders an empty checkbox for any line that starts with `- [ ]`. A checked checkbox is rendered for lines starting with `- [x]`. Clicking a checkbox changes its state in the markdown file.\n\n## General Workflows\n\nWhen working with todos sometimes you need more states than `unfinished|finished`. Below are three different workflows to delineate todo state. \n\n### Inside the Checkbox\n\n- put state in checkbox\n- note that custom checkbox states such as `[w]` are displayed as plain text in markdown previews.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you build, organize, and share knowledge bases of any size.\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1. Launch the _command bar_ inside vscode:\n   - Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n   - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n   - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n2.

Frontmatter are custom attributes at the top of each markdown file. Dendron uses it to store metadata about each note and is used for features like [[publishing|dendron.topic.publishing]]. You can also add your own custom data to the frontmatter. \n\n### Creating a hierarchy\n\nTo create a hierarchy, bring up lookup again. Note that it will be pre-filled with the name of the current note. \n\nEnter ➡️ to move the cursor to the end, type `.world`, and then press enter. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.hello-world.jpg)\n\nYou have now created your first [[hierarchy|dendron.concepts#hierarchies]].\n\nHierarchy in dendron are just `.` delimited files. You can open the tree view (exhibit 1) to see the hierarchy more directly. You can see how the note looks on disk in the explorer view (exhibit 2).\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.tree-view.jpg)\n\nDendron uses (flexible) hierarchies to help you organize your notes. It's how people are able to manage tens of thousands of notes inside Dendron. This will become more clear as we go through this tutorial.\n\nNote that you can create a hierarchy at any level without friction. For example, type the following into lookup and hit enter: `lets.go.deep`\n\nYou'll notice in the tree view that there is now a `+` sign next to `lets` and `go`. The plus sign indicates that this note is a [[stub|dendron.concepts#stubs]]. A stub is a placeholder for a note that hasn't actually been created. Dendron uses stubs to avoid cluttering your file system with empty notes when creating hierarchies. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.deep.jpg)\n\n### Finding Notes\n\nTo find notes, we use the same lookup interface that we used to create them. Type the path of the note that you want to find them. Note that lookup uses fuzzy search which means you can type out partial results and still see the results. In practice, you'll only need to type a couple of characters to find any note stored inside Dendron.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.lookup-fuzzy.jpg)\n\n\n### Files\n\nAt the end of this module, you should have the following files in your vault\n\n```\n.\n└── vault\n    ├── dendron.md\n    ├── dendron.welcome.md\n    ├── hello.md\n    ├── hello.world.md\n    └── lets.go.deep.md\n```\n\n### Next\n- [[Working with Links|dendron.tutorial.links]]","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/784b8d5e-58eb-4e3e-98b0-8ed1690abc74.html","relUrl":"notes/784b8d5e-58eb-4e3e-98b0-8ed1690abc74.html"},{"doc":"Working with Links","title":"Working with Links","hpath":"dendron.tutorial.links","content":"\n## Summary\n\nIn this module, we will demonstrate how to use links and backlinks to create connections between your notes. \n\n### Creating a link\n\nLets say that you work at a small IT firm and you want to create onboarding docs for your employees. \n\n\nCreate a new note using lookup called `onboarding`. Then type in the following in the note.\n\n```\nRead up on `[[`\n```\n\nThe `[[` tells Dendron that you are about to create a link. Dendron will auto-complete with a matching set of closing brackets `]]` as well as give you a list of completions of existing notes.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.completion.jpg)\n\nWe are going to create a new note instead of linking to an existing note. So type `pro.skynet` as your link. \n\n```\nRead up on [[pro.skynet]]\n```\n\nIn this case, `pro` is an alias for `projects` and `skynet` is the code name of the project. \n\n### Creating a note (with a link)\n\nWith your cursor somewhere inside `[[pro.skynet]]`, hit `F12`. This will create the `pro.skynet` note. Just like with lookup, Dendron automatically creates notes to links that don't exist when you navigate to them. \n\nYou can switch back to the previous note by pressing `CTRL-Tab`\n\n- TIP: `F12` is not the most convenient shortcut for this often used action. You can switch it to `CTRL-ENTER` or something more convenient by updating the [[keybindings|dendron.topic.keybindings#add-reset-and-remove]]\n\n### Adding a link alias\n\nYou can add an alternative title to the link by creating an alias. For example, add `the project|` to your link to change the name in the preview, (If you've closed your preview, you can open it using `CMD+SHIFT+P` or `WINDOWS+SHIFT+P`).\n\n```\nRead up on [[the project|pro.skynet]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.alias.jpg)\n\n### Navigating links\n\nTo go back to the previous page, you can either use `CTRL-TAB`, hit `F12` over the link, click the link on the preview, or click the link inside the note while holding down the `option` or `ctrl` key (operating system dependent). \n\nThe takeaway here is that you have lots of ways to navigate links in Dendron. \n\n### Backlinks\n\nWhen your back on `pro.skynet`, open the backlinks panel on the bottom left section of your sidebar. The backlinks panel shows you all notes with links that point to the current note. This is useful for helping to establish context.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.backlinks.jpg)\n\n### Note References\n\nInside `pro.skynet`, copy and paste the following snippet.\n\n```md\n## Summary\n\nSkynet is a friendly bot to help humans do more\n\n## Principles\n- [[pro.skynet.principals]]\n\n```\n\nNavigate to `pro.skynet.principals`. In this new note, write the principles for skynet. \n\n```md\n1. Help humans do more\n2. Be nice to humans\n3. Don't overthrow humanity\n```\n\nWhile its nice to have principals in its own section, it's something you might want to include in the main project note. To embed a note into another note, Dendron uses [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]]. You can create a note reference by using `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+R` while inside a note. Go ahead and do that now and use `CTRL-TAB` to switch back to `pro.skynet`. Now paste the reference and remove the original wiki-link.\n\n```md\n## Summary\n\nSkynet is a friendly bot to help humans do more\n\n## Principles\n![[pro.skynet.principals]]\n\n```\n\nYou should have a screen like the one below.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.refs.jpg)\n\n### Note References (continued)\n\nNote references are extremely powerful and help you re-use your notes in a variety of places. To demonstrate, go back to the `pro.skynet.principals` and make the following modifications to the text so that each numbered bullet becomes its own header.\n\n```md\n## Help humans do more\n\nSkynet should help humans be the best human they can be. Skynet will do this using ultrasophisticated AI to help humans realize their true potential.\n\n## Be nice to humans\n\nSkynet should know that humans are delicate organic lifeforms and treat them as such. Skynet should not hurt their fragile egos or make humans feel bad.\n\n## Don't overthrow humanity\n\nSkynet should not launch nuclear missles or send robots from the future to come back to the past and wipe out humanity. \n```\n\nNow highlight the first header and use `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+R` to create another note reference.\n\nGo back to `pro.skynet`. Notice how the note ref has updated with the latest text. \n\nNow copy your newly created reference and paste it underneath.\n- notice that the newly created reference only has the contents from the newly created header\n- notice that the newly created reference doesn't show the actual header itself (you can change this behavior by removing the `,1` inside the reference)\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/c62f82859545444a9786abaa36426b62\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n\nNote references are incredibly powerful. You can do additional things like enter a range of headers to do a reference of, include a reference within a reference, and even reference multiple pages using a wildcard pattern. You can see detailed examples of all these functions in the [[docs|dendron.topic.refs]].\n\n### Relative Links\n\nSometimes, you don't want to embed a note but just link to a particular section of a given note. You can do that with Dendron relative links. The syntax to do so is `[[{link-name}#{link-header}]]`. Dendron will create a relative link automatically if you select the header and use `CMD|CTRL+SHIFT+C` to create a link (if you don't have a header selected, Dendron will create a regular link to the whole page). When you navigate to a regular link, Dendron will scroll to that specific section of the page.\n\n### Link Previews\n\nSomething to point out is that you can preview a link by using your mouse to hover over it. This even works for note references. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/quickstart.links-preview.jpg)\n\n### Non-Markdown Links\n\n ![[dendron.topic.links#other-links,1]]\n\n### Files\n\nAt the end of this module, you should have the following files in your vault\n\n```\n.\n└── vault\n    ├── dendron.md\n    ├── dendron.welcome.md\n    ├── hello.md\n    ├── hello.world.md\n    ├── lets.go.deep.md\n    ├── onboarding.md\n    ├── pro.skynet.md\n    └── pro.skynet.principals.md\n```\n\n### Next\n- [[Publishing your notes|dendron.tutorial.publishing]]","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/d758fe38-558c-4f20-a091-cac146a781cb.html","relUrl":"notes/d758fe38-558c-4f20-a091-cac146a781cb.html"},{"doc":"Topics","title":"Topics","hpath":"dendron.topic","content":"\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/7a7af2fa-b9d0-4adc-81e6-f03186123539.html","relUrl":"notes/7a7af2fa-b9d0-4adc-81e6-f03186123539.html"},{"doc":"Workbench","title":"Workbench","hpath":"dendron.topic.workbench","content":"The Dendron workbench is the overall UI that surrounds the editor.

This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes at scale. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\nSchemas show up as icons next to lookup results.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.intro.gif)\n\n## Why Use Schemas\n\nSchemas help you categorize your notes by making sure your hierarchies are consistent with one another. \n\nFor example, lets say you have a bunch of projects and you know you like to keep your projects in the following hierarchy\n\n```\n.\n└── project\n    ├── retrospective\n    ├── people\n    ├── todo\n    └── meet\n```\n\nSchemas will autosuggest valid children when you create a new project.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.suggest.gif)\n\nIf you accidentally do a typo, your schema will let you know that you have an inconsistency. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.unknown.gif)\n\n## Schema Anatomy\n\nA schema is a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml`\n\nBelow is an example of a four-level hierarchy describing cli commands. The `id` field of the schema is used to build a [glob pattern](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/) which will be used to match notes matching the schema.\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n# this will match \"cli.*\" notes\n- id: cli \n  # human readable description of hierarchy\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  # add this to the domain of your schema hierarchy\n  parent: root\n  # when a schema is a namespace, it can have arbitrary children. equivalent to cli.* glob pattern\n  namespace: true \n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n# will match cli.*.env\n- id: env\n  desc: cli specific env variables\n# will match cli.*.cmd.*\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  namespace: true\n```\n\nBelow is another way of representing the above schema\n\n```\n.\n└── cli # matches cli\n    └── {cli child} # matches cli.*\n        ├── env # matches cli.*.env\n        └── cmd # matches cli.*.cmd\n            └── {cmd child} # matches cli.*.cmd.*\n```\n\n## Schema Properties\n\n### version (optional): number\n\n- values: `0|1`\n- default: 0\n- description: schema version number\n\n### imports (optional): str\\[]\n\n- values: list of schemas to import\n- default: \\[]\n- description: import schemas from another schema into the current schema\n  - when using schemas from an external schema file, you will need to prefix the schema with the file name without the `schema.yml` suffix\n- NOTE: `import` is only available in schema version `1`\n\nExample:\n\n- foo.schema. yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nimports:\n- bar\nschemas:\n- id: foo\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - bar.bar # notice that we prefix the id bar with the filename\n```\n\n- bar.schema.yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n- id: bar\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - one\n- id: one\n```\n\nThe above would match the following files\n\n```\nfoo.bar # match\nfoo.bar.one #match\n```\n\n### schemas\n\n- list of schema entities\n\n#### id\n\nthe identifier of the schema. also designates the glob pattern match. this is the **only** required part of a schema. all other fields are optional\n\n#### desc\n\nhuman readable description of the schema node. these will automatically when creating notes that match the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-desc.gif)\n\n#### parent\n\n- only required for schema [domain](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#domain)\n- NOTE: at least one schema MUST have `parent: root` set \n\n#### namespace\n\nmaking a schema node a namespace automatically brings its immediate children as part of the schema, even if they are not explicitly defined in the schema definition. it will also automatically set the pattern to `{namespace}.*`\n\n- example:\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: project\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n```\n\n- this will match: \n  - `project`\n  - `project.foo`\n  - `project.bar`\n- it will not match\n  - `project.foo.bar`\n\n#### pattern\n\nglob pattern that schema matches. by default, this is the `id` of the schema. you can override this. \n\nFor example, take a look at the journal schema below\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - year\n- id: year\n  title: year\n  pattern: \"[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"\n  children: \n    - month\n- id: month\n  title: month\n  pattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\n  children: \n    - day\n- id: day\n  title: day\n  pattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nThis will match the following queries\n\n```\n# journal\n# journal.2020\n# journal.2020.09\n# journal.2020.09.12\n# journal.2020.09.12.foo.md\n```\n\n#### children\n\nlist of ids of schemas that are the child of the current schema\n\n#### template\n\na template you can apply to all notes that match this schema. See **Schema Templates** for more details.\n\n```yml\ntemplate:\n  # identifier for the template (for a note based template, it would be the name of the note)\n  id: journal.template.daily\n  # what sort of template we are creating. currently, only 'note' is supported\n  type: note\n\n```\n\n## Schema Templates\n\nSchema templates let you designate a note as a **template**. Newly created notes that match a schema with a template will have both the contents and custom frontmatter of the template note applied at creation.\n\nThis is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n## Unknown Schema\n\nDendron doesn't force you to use schemas if you don't want to. This is why you can create notes that don't match any schema. Dendron will show you a `?` next to these results.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\n## Working with Schemas\n\nSchemas can be modified, created and deleted using the same lookup interface that you use for regular notes. See [[lookup|dendron.topic.lookup]] for further details about working with schemas.\n\n## Example Schemas\n\n- [Project and Journal](https://gist.github.com/kevinslin/5ca7a6f25a239add5ea374f329e6a19e)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Error with parsing some schemas during initialization\n\nIf you get this error, it means that Dendron encountered some malformed schemas during initialization. You can open the error message to see what schemas are affected.\n\nCommon errors:\n\n- the YAML isn't valid (use <http://www.yamllint.com/> to validate)\n- there is no schema with `parent: root` property \n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.schema]]#parent:#*))\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html","relUrl":"notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html"},{"doc":"References","title":"References","hpath":"dendron.topic.refs","content":"Dendron allows you to reference content from other notes and embed them in your current note.\n\nCurrently, Dendron supports 3 types of references:\n\n- note references\n- block references\n- block range references\n\nReferences have the following syntax\n\n```\n![[ NAME_OF_NOTE \n    #STARTING_HEADER                            # optional\n    :#ENDING_HEADER                             # optional\n]]\n```\n\n- NOTE: Dendron recently switched the note ref syntax for `((ref: [[foo]]))` to `![[foo]]`. The videos have not yet been updated to reflect this change\n\n## Configuration\n\n- note references by default come with an outline. They are called [[pretty refs|dendron.ref.terms#pretty-ref]]. \n\n\nToggle the following configuration to turn off this setting.\n\n![[dendron.topic.config#useprettyrefs:#*]]\n\n## Commands\n\nYou can create a ref either by hand or using the `Copy Note Ref` command.\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref:#*]]\n\n## Note Reference\n\nA note reference will include the entire contents of a note within another note. Below is an example of a note reference.\n\n```\n![[dendron.demo.refs.sample]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.block.gif)\n\nNote that references also respect the wildcard operator. The following example will include all child pages of sample. \n\n```\n![[dendron.demo.refs.sample.*]]\n```\n\n## Block Reference\n\nA block reference will include the entire contents of a note starting from a specified heading. \n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-block.gif)\n\n## Block Range Reference\n\nA block range reference will include the contents of a note starting from a `start` header and ending at a `end` header. \n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1:#head3]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/ref-block-range.gif)\n\n## Note Reference Offset\n\nA note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embeding.\n\n- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value\n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1,1]]\n```\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1\">  <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n## Wildcard Header Reference\n\nWhen you're referencing a header by reference, sometimes you don't care what the next header is, just that the reference covers all text up to the next header. You can now specify this using the `*` symbol in a header reference.\n\nFor example, the following would reference the content from header1 to the next header. \n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1:#*]]\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.wildcard.gif)\n\n## Recursive Reference\n\nNote references can refer to notes with references inside. Dendron current supports references two levels deep. This applies to both the **local preview** as well as **publishing**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/refs.recursion.jpg)\n\n## Wildcard Note Refs\n\n[[Note references|dendron.topic.refs]] accept the `*` operator at the end which lets you grab all notes of a given level of hierarchy. This also works with typical note reference operation like block selection which means you can use it to grab specific blocks from every note in a level.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/9401e5dfe60f4f589e14d50e280d11f5\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html","relUrl":"notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html"},{"doc":"Publishing","title":"Publishing","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing","content":"\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/579e379b-3eca-4676-b51c-c66eb26a11b8.html","relUrl":"notes/579e379b-3eca-4676-b51c-c66eb26a11b8.html"},{"doc":"Troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.troubleshooting","content":"### Site Preview shows \"Cannot Get/\"\n\nCauses:\n\n1.

Hit install to do so\n     ![Install dependencies](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.site-preview.jpg)\n   - when dependencies are done installing, Dendron will automatically open up a browser with a preview of your published notes (if this is the first time you've run this, VSCode will ask you for permission to open the link)\n     ![Dendron Site Preview](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.preview.jpg)\n\n### Add a note\n\n1. Right now or page is pretty sparse. Lets add some more notes\n\n   - first hit cancel on the site preview\n     ![Cancel preview](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.preview-cancel.jpg)\n   - add a `hello` note (see instructions for creating notes [[here|dendron.tutorial.notes#creating-your-first-note]])\n   - add `How do you do?` in the body so your note looks like the below (note that the id and times will be different)\n\n   ```md\n   ---\n   id: 7cefc5e1-2073-4327-86f0-a5319385a483\n   title: Hello\n   desc: ''\n   updated: 1610686311651\n   created: 1610686307785\n   ---\n\n   How do you do?\n   ```\n2. run `Site: Preview` again to see the results\n   ![Dendron site with new note](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.with-hello.jpg)\n3. click `hello` to navigate to your new note\n   ![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.with-hello.jpg)\n4. Alternatively, you can also use the search bar on the top to do a lookup of your note by path or title\n   <div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/0cf674234df34854a988176b189156b2\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Get ready to publish\n\nWhen you are ready, you can go to [[publishing your site|dendron.topic.publishing.quickstart.publishing-your-site]] for instructions on announcing your site to the world.\n\n## CLI\n\nThe following describes how to prepare your notes for publication using [[Dendron CLI|dendron.topic.cli]].\n\n### Requirements\n\n- pre-requisitie: \n  - node version 0.12 or higher, see installation guide [[here Node|dendron.guides.install-node]]\n\n### Setup\n\nIn order to to use the 11ty based publishing, initialize your workspace with the following commands.\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty@latest\n```\n\n### Local Preview\n\nAfter you have your dependencies installed, build your your site using the following command.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage dev --serve\n```\n\nThis will both compile your site locally and make it available at `localhost:8080` for instant preview. When building your site locally, the pages will be build to `{wsRoot}/build/site`. \n\n<!--\n### Adding metadata\n\nCurrently, your site is rather spare. You can add metadata to your site. Open the config by going to `Dendron: Configure (yaml)`. This should take you to the following configuration file\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - root\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n```\n\nTry adding some of the following properties underneath site\n    - replace `{YOUR NAME}` with your actual name\n\n```yml\n...\nsite:\n    ...\n    title: {YOUR NAME} Digital Garden\n    description: This is {YOUR NAME} piece of the internet\n    author:  `{YOUR NAME}`\n```\n\nWhen your done, run the pre\n\n-->\n\n### Build for deployment\n\nWhen you are ready to publish to github, make sure to change the stage to `prod`.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage prod \n```\n\nThis will build your site to the path specified by [[siteRootDir|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#siterootdir-required]] in `dendron.yml`.

It takes a list of [[vault names|dendron.topic.config#name]]. When a duplicate is found, Dendron will go throw the vaults in your list from left to right and resolve to the first one that matches.\n\n- NOTE: this is done automatically when you run the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] command \n\n```yml\nduplicateNoteBehavior: \n  action: \"useVault\"\n  payload: [{vault1}, {vault2}, {vault3}]\n```\n\n### ga_tracking (optional)\n\nYour ga tracking number if you want to add google analytics. \n\n- NOTE: won't be included in `dev` preview\n\n### githubCname (optional)\n\n- default: none\n\nCname used for github pages\n\n### logo (optional)\n\n- default: none\n- eg: `vault/assets/images/logo.png`\n\nUsed to add a logo image for all headers\n\n### siteFaviconPath (optional)\n\n- default: \"favicon.ico\"\n\nPath to favicon.

Relative to your workspace\n\n### siteRepoDir (optional)\n\n- default: none\n- status: NOT currently supported \n\nLocation of the github repo where your site notes are located. By default, this is assumed to be your `workspaceRoot` if not set. This is used with the `Publish Notes` command\n\n### siteUrl \n- required\n\nSet to the URL that you plan on publishing to. All links will be prefixed with this. \nIf you are publishing with github pages, the format is `https://{username}.github.io/{repo}/`\n\n### usePrettyRefs (optional)\n\n- default: True\n\nWhether to use pretty note refs or plain refs. \n\n### writeStubs (optional)\n\n- default: true\n\nWhether to write [[stubs|dendron.concepts#stubs]] when publishing. \n\nWriting a stub will create an empty note in your vault with the name of the stub. \n\nWriting stubs is important to guarantee permanent urls as Dendron will randomize stub ids whenever Dendron restarts. \n\n### Github Options\n\n#### gh_edit_link\n\n- default: true\n  Show a edit on github link at the bottom of the page\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publish.edit-on-github.jpg)\n\n#### gh_edit_repository\n\nthe URL of the project's GitHub repository\n\n- NOTE: if you are using [[remote vaults|dendron.concepts#remote-vault]], this value will be ignored and the [[remote url|dendron.topic.config#remote]] will be used instead\n\n#### gh_edit_branch\n\n- default: master\n\nthe branch that the docs site is served from\n\n#### gh_edit_view_mode\n\n- default: tree (brings user to github page)\n\nswitch to \"edit\" to bring the user directly into editing mode\n\n### SEO Options\n\n#### title\n\n- title of page\n- eg: `Dendron`\n\n#### description\n\n- eg: `Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you create, organize, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.`\n\n#### author\n\nName of person or organization doing the publishing\n\n- eg: `Kevin`\n\n#### twitter\n\nTwitter Handle\n\n- eg: `dendronhq`\n\n## Hierarchy Configuration\n\nYou can update configuration on a per hierarchy level by modifying `site.config` like in the example below\n\n```yml\nsite:\n  config: \n    dendron:\n      publishByDefault: true\n      ...\n```\n\nTo set options for **all** hierarchies, set `{hiearchy name}` to **root**.\n\n### publishByDefault\n\n- default: true \n- values: true|false|hashByVault\n\nIf set to false, dendron will only publish notes within the hierarchy that have `published: true` set in the frontmatter\n\nIf set as a hash, you can further specify `publishByDefault` settings on a per vault basis. The key is the name of the vault and the value is a boolean. \n\nFor example, the following config says that the `finance` hiearchy in the `public` vault should all be published but that the `finance` hiearchy in the `private` vault should not\n\n```yml\nsite: \n  config:\n    finance:\n      publishByDefault:\n        public: true\n        private: false\n```\n\n### noindexByDefault\n\n- default: false\n- status: NOT currently supported\n\nIf set to true, dendron will add the following meta tag `<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, nofollow”>` which will tell google to not index your page\n\nWhen google indexes a page, it will penalize sites that have duplicate content from other sites. this is useful if you are using your hiearchy as a [[cache|dendron.workflows.cache]]\n\n### customFrontmatter\n\n- default: \\[]\n\nIf set, dendron will add the specified frontmatter to each published note in the hierarchy. note that this will override existing keys with the same name when publishing\n\n- eg. add `toc: true` to all notes published under the `iam.*` hierarchy\n\n```yml\n  config:\n    iam: \n        customFrontmatter: [\n          {\n            key: \"toc\",\n            value: true,\n          }\n        ]\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example publishing entire vault\n\n- vault\n\n```\n.\n├── root.md\n├── dendron.md\n├── dendron.quickstart.md\n├── dendron.zen.md\n├── flowers.md\n└── flowers.bud.md\n```\n\n- dendron.yml\n\n```yml\npublish:\n  siteHierarchies: [root]\n```\n\n- what gets published\n\n```\n.\n└── root.md\n    ├── dendron\n    │   ├── dendron.quickstart\n    │   └── dendron.zen\n    └── flowers\n        └── flowers.bud\n```\n\n### Example publishing just one domain\n\n- vault\n\n```\n.\n├── root.md\n├── dendron.md\n├── dendron.quickstart.md\n└── dendron.zen.md\n```\n\n- dendron.yml\n\n```yml\npublish:\n  siteHierarchies: [dendron]\n```\n\n- published:\n\n```\n.\n└── dendron\n    ├── dendron.quickstart\n    └── dendron.zen\n```\n\n### Examples of CNAME, Github and SEO Options\n\n```yml\nsite:\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    gh_edit_repository: \"https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site\"\n    logo: \"vault/assets/images/logo.png\"\n    siteUrl: \"https://dendron.so\"\n    githubCname: \"dendron.so\"\n    title: Dendron\n    author: \"dendronhq\"\n    twitter: \"dendronhq\"\n    description: \"Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you create, organize, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\"\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\n```\n\n## Note Configuration\n\nYou can specify how notes are published via the frontmatter of each note. \n\n### published\n\n- default: true\n\nTo exclude a page from publication, you can add the following to the frontmatter. If you set `publishByDefault: false` for a hierarchy, this needs to be set to `true` to publish\n\n```yml\n...\npublished: false\n```\n\n### nav_exclude\n\nIf set, do not include the current note in the navigation bar. \n\n### nav_order\n\n- type: number\n\nIf set, denote order that item appears in the published nav bar\n\n### noindex\n\n- default: false\n\nTo tell google to not index a page, you can add the following tag to the frontmatter. You can also have this as a default for a given hierarchy by setting `noIndexByDefault: true` in the site config.\n\n```yml\n...\nnoindex: true\n```\n\n### collection options\n\n#### has_collection\n\n- default: false\n\nWhether a given page is a collection. A collection doesn't have a table of contents and allows you to set collection specific options.\n\n#### date\n\nIf set, used to designate a custom publication date. By default, use timestamp of `created` field. \n\n#### skipLevels\n\nIf set, determines how many levels of children to skip when making the collection. For example, you might have the following hierarchy. \n\n```\n- blog.md\n- blog.reading.md\n- blog.reading.journal.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.20.one.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.31.two.md\n```\n\nWhen you publish, you might only want to show the leaf nodes and skip the intermediary levels. In the above example, setting `skipLevels: 3` on `blog.reading.md` will result in the following hierarchy being published.\n\n```\n- blog.md\n- blog.reading.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.20.one.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.31.two.md\n```\n\n#### sort_order\n\n- default: `ascending`\n- values: `ascending|reverse`\n\nSort items in a collection page. Ascending by default. Specify `reverse` to sort in descending order.\n\n## Line Configuration\n\nYou can control publication on a per line basis.\n\n### LOCAL_ONLY_LINE\n\n`\n\n```markdown\nHello World!  <!-- Will be published -->\n\n <!-- won't be published -->\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/pod-local.gif)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713.html","relUrl":"notes/f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713.html"},{"doc":"Collections","title":"Collections","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.collections","content":"Sometimes, you might want to publish a page that has all its children listed like in a blog archive format. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.collection.jpg)\n\nThis format is called a `collection` in Dendron.

Depending on what notes you want to publish, you will want to update your `dendron.yml` file. By default, everything will be published\n2. Update the contents of `_config.yml` inside your `docs` folder to specify site wide configuration like logo and title.\n   - NOTE: this is located relative to `dendron.rootDir`\n   - if you do not have a `docs` folder, you can run `Dev:Dendron: Doctor` to create one\n3. When you are ready to publish, run the `> Dendron: Build Pod` command to prepare your site for publication. This builds your notes into the `siteRootDir` directory which defaults to `docs`. `Build Pod` does the following when it builds your site:\n   - copies over the notes specified in `dendron.yml`\n   - creates a copy of your notes with the ids in place of the file names \n   - updates all `wiki-links` to `markdown-links` so Jekyll can process it, preserving titles if there are any\n4.

PowerShell / cmd) and type `ruby -v`. If the error message \"_ruby : The term 'ruby' is not recognized_\" comes up do the following:\n\n- Navigate [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and download the recommended **Ruby+Devkit** and then open the downloaded file.\n- When the installation is complete you will see an option to Run `ridk install`. Make sure this is checked as it is needed for installing Jekyll and click finish.\n- A terminal window will open asking what components to install - Simply press the `enter` key to install the default components.\n- Close the terminal and reopen a new iteration to ensure that the Path variables have been set.\n- In the newly opened Terminal run `ruby -v` and you should get `ruby 2.6.6p146 (2020-03-31 revision 67876) [x64-mingw32]` or similar back.\n\n## Installing Jekyll\n\n- From the Terminal type `gem install jekyll bundler` and let it run until finished (takes a few minutes).\n- When completed run `jekyll -v` and the Terminal should return with something like: `jekyll 4.1.1`.\n\nStep 1 and 2 over and done with.\n\n## Setting up the Environment\n\n- In the Terminal navigate to the `docs` folder within your dendron vault.\n  - The easiest way to do this is to copy the location of the folder in File Explorer and then go to the Terminal and type `cd ` and paste the copied text and then click enter. \n- Run `bundle install`\n\nWe are approaching the finishing line.\n\n## Publishing Our Notes\n\nIn order for our notes / markdown files to be published we need to carry out the following steps:\n\n- From within Dendron, run the \"Build Pod\" command by clicking `ctrl + Shift + P` and typing Pod. This will bring up the option `> Dendron: Build Pod`, select it and click enter.\n- In the bottom right hand side after a few seconds you should see \"finished\".\n\n## Last Step\n\n- Open the terminal and type `bundle exec jekyll serve` \n- This will run a configuration to generate the markdown files to static pages so that they can be viewed online. \n- Once the above step is completed, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`. \n- You should see a copy of your notes using a similar theme as this one.\n\nYou will be able to see any changes you do to your notes in Dendron on the localhost. \n\nThink this deserves a high five! \n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/63b184f7-1901-4580-af40-97ef87069a04.html","relUrl":"notes/63b184f7-1901-4580-af40-97ef87069a04.html"},{"doc":"Configuration","title":"Configuration","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing-legacy.configuration","content":"Dendron lets you control publication behavior at three levels:\n\n- **globally** through `dendron.yml` configuration\n- **per note** through the publication related frontmatter\n- **per line** through custom dendron directives inside the note\n\n## Global Configuration\n\nThe `dendron.yml` configuration file controls what notes get published.

If you are publishing to github pages and followed the instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/) by creating a repo named `{username}.github.io`, then no further action is needed. This is because github will make your site available at `https://{username}.github.io`. If you created a custom repo, you will need to set the prefix to the name of your repo because github will make your site available at `https://username.github.io/{your-repo-name/}`\n\n#### copyAssets\n\n- required: no\n- type: boolean\n- default: true\n\nCopy assets from vault to site.\n\n#### siteHierarchies: str\\[]\n\nList of hierarchies to publish\n\n#### siteIndex?: str\n\n- optional, path of your index (home page)\n- defaults to the first element of `siteHierarchies`\n\n#### siteRootDir\n\nLocation of the directory where site will be build.

Tools like Evernote and Roam are pods. Social media services like Twitter and Facebook are pods. Publication destinations like static sites and Medium are pods. Everything is a pod.\n\nPods let you do the following:\n\n- **import** your notes from any existing location into Dendron\n- **export** your notes from Dendron to any existing location\n- **publish** your notes from Dendron to any existing location\n\nTo access pods, Dendron exposes three commands:\n\n- `Dendron: Import Pod`: imports notes \n- `Dendron: Export Pod`: export notes \n- `Dendron: Publish Pod`: publish notes \n\n**NOTE**: not all pods will expose all three commands. Each pod implementation can choose to implement any subset of the three commands. \n\n## Pod Methods\n\n### Import\n\nImporting lets you bulk import notes from a given source and into Dendron. The notes are formatted and converted to Dendron's hierarchal structure.\n\n### Export\n\nExporting lets you bulk export notes from Dendron into another destinations. The notes will be formatted and converted to the native format of the destination. \n\n### Publish\n\nPublishing lets you take one note and output it into a different format/destination. \n\nFor example, you might want to use our [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown]] to take a note with [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] and publish it as a regular markdown note to use in a github issue or another tool.\n\nFuture uses of the **publish** method will be taking a note and publishing it to social media (eg. twitter, facebook, linkedin), publishing it to Gmail, and publishing to destinations like Medium and dev.to.\n\n## Types of Pods\n\nThere are two types of pods:\n\n- builtin: created by dendron \n- remote: created by third parties\n\n![[dendron.topic.pod.builtin#summary,1:]]\n![[dendron.topic.pod.custom#summary,1:]]\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html","relUrl":"notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html"},{"doc":"Sdk Reference","title":"Sdk Reference","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.sdk","content":"\n\n## PublishPod\n\nBase class to be extended when creating a pod for [[publishing|dendron.topic.pod#publish]]\n\n### plant(opts: PublishPodPlantOpts<T>)\n- opts\n    - engine: DEngineClientV2\n    - config: PublishPodConfig\n    - note: NotePropsV2\n```ts\nexport type NotePropsV2 = {\n  id: string;\n  title: string;\n  desc: string;\n  links: DLink[];\n  fname: string;\n  updated: string;\n  created: string;\n  parent: DNodePointerV2 | null;\n  children: DNodePointerV2[];\n  body: string;\n  custom?: any;\n  schema?: { moduleId: string; schemaId: string };\n  vault: DVault;\n  ...\n};\n```","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/6301a5b4-d88f-4ecd-ad72-0880b1bf14b0.html","relUrl":"notes/6301a5b4-d88f-4ecd-ad72-0880b1bf14b0.html"},{"doc":"Developing a Pod","title":"Developing a Pod","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.dev","content":"## Summary\n\n- status: WORK_IN_PROGRESS 🚧\n\nIn this module, we'll go over how to create a custom pod. You can clone the end result [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/hello-pod)\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\n- Install dendron-cli\n  ![[dendron.topic.cli#installation,1:#*]]\n- [[Install Dendron|dendron.guides.install#install]] and have a workspace initialized\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Create your pod\n\n- NOTE: this tutorial goes over developing using javascript. All Dendron packages are typed and can also be developed using typescript\n\n```sh\nmkdir hello-pod\nnpm init -y\nnpm install --save @dendronhq/pods-core\ntouch index.js\n```\n\nOpen index.js and add the following\n\n```js\nconst { PublishPod } = require(\"@dendronhq/pods-core\");\n\nclass HelloPod extends PublishPod {\n  static id = \"hello\";\n  static description = \"Add a hello statement\";\n\n  async plant(opts) {\n    const { note } = opts;\n    const body = note.body;\n    return [\"Hello World\", body].join(\"\\n\");\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  pods: [HelloPod],\n};\n```\n\n## Testing your pod\n\n1. Create a symlink of your current package. This lets you use your package locally in other projects\n   ```sh\n   npm link\n   ```\n2. Go to your [[workspace root|dendron.ref.layout#workspace-root]].\n   ```sh\n   cd $WORKSPACE_ROOT\n   ```\n3. If you don't have a `package.json` already , create one by running `npm init -y`\n   ```sh\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n4. Link to your created pod\n   ```sh\n   npm link hello-pod\n   ```\n5. Excecute your pod\n   ```sh\n   dendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --podId hello --podPkg hello-pod --podSource remote --config fname=dendron,vaultName=vault,dest=stdout\n   ```\n   - since I was running this in a new Dendron vault, I got the following output\n\n```markdown\nHello World\n\n## The Trail 🥾\n\nHere are the basics of Dendron so you can get started growing your knowledge base.\n- [ ] Create your first note.\n    - [ ] Dendron uses the [lookup](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#lookup-menu) command to create. So, hit CMD+L (or ctrl+L if you're on Windows) to bring up the lookup bar, type in a new note name and hit enter to create it. You can also run the lookup command through the command palette \"Dendron: Lookup\".\n    - [ ] Wiki-style links are supported. If the note doesn't exist, we'll create the note for you. For example, just try [[this link]] from the editor view.\n- [ ] Find your notes. Dendron really shines when you need to look up notes quickly. For this, you use *drumroll* the lookup command (again). Just hit CMD/ctrl+L and you can search your entire set of notes.\n- [ ] To delete a note, navigate to it and use the \"Dendron: Delete Node\" command. As with everything else in VSCode, bring up the command palette with CMD/ctrl+shift+P and run the command.\n- [ ] Use a [snippet](https://www.dendron.so/notes/9eca1992-7540-4d9d-97fb-328b27748b2c.html) for quick note templates\n- [ ] Insert an [image](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a91fd8da-6895-49fe-8164-a17acd8d9a17.html)\n- [ ] Create some [links](https://www.dendron.so/notes/3472226a-ff3c-432d-bf5d-10926f39f6c2.html)\n- [ ] [Publish](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html) your vault\n- [ ] Join us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6j85zNX) and discuss all things knowledge management with your fellow trail blazers.\n- [ ] For more information, see Dendron's basic [concepts](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html)\n```\n\n### Pass in custom configuration values\n\nWe're going to make our publishing a little more dynamoc by using custom configuration. \n\nModify your pod to accept a new configuration parameter\n\n```js\nconst { PublishPod } = require(\"@dendronhq/pods-core\");\n\nclass HelloPod extends PublishPod {\n  static id = \"hello\";\n  static description = \"Add a hello statement\";\n\n  get config() {\n    return super.config.concat([\n      {\n        key: \"name\",\n        description: \"dev.to api key\",\n        type: \"string\",\n      },\n    ]);\n  }\n\n  async plant(opts) {\n    const { note, config } = opts;\n    const body = note.body;\n    return [`Hello ${config.name}`, body].join(\"\\n\");\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  pods: [HelloPod],\n};\n\n```\n\nBelow is a diff to make the changes a bit more obvious.\n![diff of code](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/pod-change.jpg)\n\nRun the pod again the the additional argument.\n\n````\n```sh\ndendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --podId hello --podPkg hello-pod --podSource remote --config fname=dendron,vaultName=vault,dest=stdout,name=Albert\n```\n````\n\n```markdown\nHello Albert\n\n## The Trail 🥾\n...\n```\n\n### Use Note Metadata\n\nPods have full access to all the metadata attached to a note.

Each vault is a folder that can contain any number of hierarchies. \n\n## Use Cases\n\n- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox \n- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context\n- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`\n- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault\n\n## Quickstart\n\n- TODO\n\n## Concepts\n\n![[dendron.concepts#workspace:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#vaults:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#hierarchies:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#domain:#*]]\n\n## Topics\n\n### Commands\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.commands]]#vault add:#*))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.commands]]#vault remove:#*))\n\n### Lookup\n\nLookup supports multiple vaults. When using lookup to find a note, each search result is labeled with which vault it belongs to. \n\nWhen creating a note in lookup, the currently opened note's vault is used as the vault for the new note.\n\n#### Specify Vault Location when Creating a Note\n\n![[dendron.topic.config#lookupconfirmvaultoncreate:#*]]\n\nTo enable,  add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` in the dendron configuration. Instructions to do so below.\n\n1. > Dendron: Configure (yaml)\n2. add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` so your configuration looks like the following:\n\n```yml\nversion: 0\n...\nlookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true\n```\n\n### Navigating Links\n- Sample workspace\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- navigating  to `[[foo]]` will result in a display prompting the user to select the vault to navigate to \n- navigating to `[[foo.two]]` will directly navigate to the note since it is unique across all vaults\n- navigating to `[[vault1/foo]]` will open `foo` in vault1 \n- navigating to `[[dendron://vault2/foo]]` will open `foo` in vault1\n\n### Note References\n\n~~[[Note references|dendron.topic.refs]] are vault specific~~ When you make a reference, Dendron will include the note from the same note. You can create a reference to a note in a different vault by using [[cross vault links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]].\n\n\n### Publishing\n\nYou can publish from a multi-vault enabled workspace if you are using [[dendron-11ty|dendron.pro.dendron-11ty]] to publish. \n\nWe have added a new configuration, `duplicateNoteBehavior`, which [[controls|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#duplicatenotebehavior-optional]] how Dendron handles duplicate notes across multiple vaults. \n\n### Version Control\n\nFor multi-vault, there are several approaches to version control. If you are using Git, you can either commit everything as one repo or version control your workspace and each vault separately as distinct repos.\n\nIf you use `Vault: Add` with a remote vault, Dendron will automatically add the remote properties to your `dendron.yml` file. See example below.\n\n![[dendron.topic.config#remote-vault-example,1:#*]]\n\nVersioned controlled vaults will be auto-initialized when someone pulls in the workspace. \n\nIf you want to convert a local vault to a remote vault, you can follow the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.cook#convert-local-vault-to-a-remote-vault]].\n\n#### File Layout for Multi-Vault Workspace\n\n```\n.\n└── Dendron\n    ├── .git\n    ├── dendron.code-workspace\n    ├── dendron.yml\n    ├── ...\n    ├── vault1\n    │   ├── .git\n    │   ├── root.md\n    │   └── ...\n    └── vault2\n        ├── .git\n        ├── root.md\n        └── ...\n```\n\n\n## Related\n- [[Cross Vault Links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]]","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0.html","relUrl":"notes/24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0.html"},{"doc":"Math","title":"Math","hpath":"dendron.topic.math","content":"Dendron uses [Katex](https://katex.org/) to render math.\n\n- Expressions inside `$...$`  will be rendered using inline format.\n- Expressions inside `$$...$$` will be rendered using block format.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Inline\n\n```\n$f(x) = sin(x)$\n```\n\nwill render as \n\n$f(x) = sin(x)$\n\n### Block\n\n```\n$$\nf(x) = sin(x)\n$$\n```\n\nwill render as\n\n$$\nf(x) = sin(x) \n$$\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/b1919663-cc48-4054-b0cf-4b26fe444907.html","relUrl":"notes/b1919663-cc48-4054-b0cf-4b26fe444907.html"},{"doc":"Markdown","title":"Markdown","hpath":"dendron.topic.markdown","content":"- Notice: all references of `MPE` in this guide is in reference to `Dendron Markdown Preview Enhanced`, the default markdown renderer of Dendron\n\n## Markdown Basics\n\nThis article is a brief introduction to [GitHub Flavored Markdown writing](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).\n\n## What is Markdown?\n\n`Markdown` is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.\n\n## Syntax guide\n\n### Headers\n\n```markdown\n# This is an <h1> tag\n\n## This is an <h2> tag\n\n### This is an <h3> tag\n\n#### This is an <h4> tag\n\n##### This is an <h5> tag\n\n###### This is an <h6> tag\n```\n\n### Emphasis\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n\n```markdown\n*This text will be italic*\n_This will also be italic_\n\n**This text will be bold**\n__This will also be bold__\n\n_You **can** combine them_\n\n~~This text will be strikethrough~~\n```\n\n### Lists\n\n#### Unordered List\n\n```markdown\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n  - Item 2a\n  - Item 2b\n```\n\n#### Ordered List\n\n```markdown\n1. Item 1\n1. Item 2\n1. Item 3\n   1. Item 3a\n   1. Item 3b\n```\n\n#### Definition List\n\n```markdown\nItem 1\n: Definition for Item 1\n\nItem 2\n~ Definition for Item 2\n~ Another definition for Item 2, with a [link](http://www.example.com)\n```\n\n### Images\n\n```markdown\n![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)\nFormat: ![Alt Text](url)\n```\n\n### Links\n\n```markdown\nhttps://github.com - automatic!\n[GitHub](https://github.com)\n```\n\n### Blockquote\n\n```markdown\nAs Kanye West said:\n\n> We're living the future so\n> the present is our past.\n```\n\n### Horizontal Rule\n\n```markdown\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n---\n\nAsterisks\n\n---\n\nUnderscores\n```\n\n### Inline code\n\n```markdown\nI think you should use an\n`<addr>` element here instead.\n```\n\n### Fenced code block\n\nYou can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks <code>\\`\\`\\`</code> before and after the code block.\n\n#### Syntax Highlighting\n\nYou can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.\n\nFor example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:\n\n````\n```ruby\nrequire 'redcarpet'\nmarkdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\nputs markdown.to_html\n```\n````\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'redcarpet'\nmarkdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\nputs markdown.to_html\n```\n\n### Task lists\n\n```markdown\n- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)\n- [x] this is a complete item\n- [ ] this is an incomplete item\n```\n\n## Extended Syntax\n\nThese are non-standard markdown syntax used in Dendron. Everything here is both available in Dendron's preview as well as when publishing.\n\n### Tables\n\nYou can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n\n```markdown\nFirst Header | Second Header\n------------ | -------------\nContent from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\nContent in the first column | Content in the second column\n```\n\nYou can create a table from existing content using `> Markdown Shortcuts: Add Table` command.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdickin/vscode-markdown-shortcuts/master/media/demo/table_with_header.gif)\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nThe HTML specification\n\n```markdown\n_[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language\n_[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium\nThe HTML specification\nis maintained by the W3C.\n```\n\n### Footnotes\n\n```markdown\nContent [^1]\n\n[^1]: Hi! This is a footnote\n```\n\n### Frontmatter Variable Substitution\n\nYou can use variables defined in your note frontmatter inside your note. The syntax is `{{fm.VAR_NAME}}` where `VAR_NAME` is the name of your variable. The `fm` designates that you want to use a frontmatter variable. \n\n### Nunjuck Templates\n- status: EXPERIMENTAL\n\nYou can use a limited set of [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to customize your notes. \n\nTo enable, you can set the following to true inside your `dendron.yml`.\n```yml\nuseNunjucks: true\n```\n\nOnce enabled, you'll have access to nunjucks specific constructs. You'll have the same variables available as during [[frontmatter variable substitution|dendron.topic.markdown#frontmatter-variable-substitution]]. Nunjucks templates also get access to the `fname` builtin variable which will be substituted with the filename of the current note. \n\nBelow is an example of what you can do with nunjucks.\n\n- Raw Markdown\n```md\n## Variables\n\n- special variables: {{fname}}\n- special variable as link: [[{{fname}}]]\n- special variable as note ref: ![[{{fname}}#footer]]\n\n## Loops\n\n{% for item in fm.alist %}\n\n- Item: {{item}}\n  {% endfor %}\n\n## Footer\n\nThis is some footer content\n```\n\n- Compiled \n![nunjucks example](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/topic.nunjucks.jpg)\n\n\nNunjucks will work for both the preview and for publishing. It is still an experimental feature which means it might change in backwards in-compatible ways at any point.\n\nIt currently also has the following limitations:\n- disables live preview of markdown (you'll need to refresh the markdown to see changes)\n- will throw an error if you currently have nunjucks like strings inside your notes `eg. {% %}`\n- will throw errors if you refer to an undefined variable `{{ foo }}` \n\n### Diagrams \n\nDendron lets you create Diagrams using [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)\nCreate a code block with mermaid support to use mermaid. The following block turns into the diagram below.\n\n<pre>\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n    B-->D;\n    C-->D;\n```\n</pre>\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n    B-->D;\n    C-->D;\n```\n\n- NOTE: in order to publish diagrams, you'll need to enable [[mermaid in the config|dendron.topic.config#mermaid-optional]]\n\n## VSCode Specific Commands\n\n### Markdown Smart Select\n\nThis allows you to expand and shrink selections of markdown using a keyboard shortcut.\n\n- Expand: ⌃⇧⌘→\n- Shrink: ⌃⇧⌘←\n\nSelection applies to the following, and follows a traditional hierarchical pattern:\n\n- Headers\n- Lists\n- Block quotes\n- Fenced code blocks\n- Html code blocks\n- Paragraphs\n\n![preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_51/markdown-smart-select-demo.gif)\n\n> Image by Microsoft\n\n## Compatibility with CommonMark\n\n[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) is _a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown_\n\nWhen possible, Dendron will try to stay to `CommonMark` spec for syntax. That being said, many of the features we have (eg. block based note references) have no common mark equivalent which is why we've had to invent new syntax.\n\nYou can use the [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown]] to migrate both individual notes and your entire vault to a CommonMark compatible format.\n\n## Other Resources\n\n- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\n- [Daring Fireball: Markdown Basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)\n- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)\n\n## References\n\nThe content of this page is derived from the following sources:\n\n1.

Go to https://app.dendron.so Create an account if you don't already have one. \n1. After you login, use \"publish a site from Github\"\n1. Enter the url of the repo that you want to publish\n1. Enter a [[personal access token|dendron.rfc.2-managed-publishing.ref.github-token]]\n\nWhen your site is ready, you should see the following screen \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/Fullscreen_2_23_21__3_39_PM.jpg)\n\n### Fine Print\n- Dendron publishes your site at `{username}.dendron.wiki` \n\n### Limitations \n- NOTE: because managed publishing is in early access, the following restrictions currently apply\n<!-- -->\n- one site per account\n- ~~no custom domains~~\n- no multi-vault support\n\n## Deleting a Site\n1. Click `Site Settings` on the site widget\n2. Click `Delete`\n\n\n## Adding a custom domain via CNAME\n\n- this feature is limited to [[environmentalist|dendron.community.roles#environmentalist]] \n\n### Pre-prequisites \n\n- have a domain that you own and control the CNAME records for\n- have your github repo hooked up to dendron (see [[Creating a site|dendron.topic.managed-publishing.quickstart#creating-a-site]])\n\n### Steps\n1. Decide on a CNAME that you want to use. Lets call this YOUR_CNAME\n1. Email support@dendron.so with the subject: `CNAME Request: YOUR_CNAME` \n1. You'll get a response with a custom CNAME entry. Add that to your DNS (instructions to do this will depend on your registrar)\n    ```\n    _5e6e3c15a64565a3fbd9609d390e06d4.www.awschangelog.com. to _1fcefb9e363e5ebc64d8bc7ad6f31535.nfyddsqlcy.acm-validations.aws.\n    ```\n1. Update YOUR_CNAME to point to `hosting.dendron.wiki`\n1. Email support@dendron.so with the subject: `CNAME Request: YOUR_CNAME - UPDATED` \n1. You'll get a response from support@dendron.so that your account is now ready for custom domains\n1. Push to the repository that you have configured with managed publishing. Dendron will now connect your repository with your CNAME\n    - NOTE: the link to view the site will still be pointed to `$username.dendron.wiki`. You'll need to manually add your CNAME to see the changes\n<!-- 1. Go to `app.dendron.so` and update your published site with the CNAME -->\n\n### Limitations\n- custom domains with CNAMES doesn't work with apex domains (these are domains without a prefix - eg. foo.com is an apex domain, www.foo.com is not)\n    - if you are interested in using an apex domain, see the guide below\n\n## Add a custom domain via delegating name servers\n- this feature is limited to [[environmentalist|dendron.community.roles#environmentalist]] \n\n### Pre-prequisites \n\n- have a domain that you own and control the name server records for\n- have your github repo hooked up to dendron (see [[Creating a site|dendron.topic.managed-publishing.quickstart#creating-a-site]])\n\n### Steps\n1. Email support@dendron.so with the subject: `NS Request: YOUR_DOMAIN` \n    - example: `NS Request: kevin.xyz`\n1. You'll get a response with a custom NS entry. Add that to your DNS (instructions to do this will depend on your registrar)\n    - example response\n    ```\n    ns-1986.awsdns-48.co.uk.\n    ns-738.awsdns-28.net.\n    ns-1484.awsdns-52.org.\n    ns-298.awsdns-37.com.\n    ```\n1. Update your domain nameserver with the results \n    - WARNING: if you are currently serving traffic via the domain, this will cause your website to be temporarily un-availble\n    - NOTE: save your current name servers as backup for when you want to revert this process\n1. Email support@dendron.so with the subject: `NS Request: YOUR_DOMAIN - UPDATED` \n1. You'll get a response from support@dendron.so that your account is now ready for custom domains\n1. Push to the repository that you have configured with managed publishing. Dendron will now connect your repository with your CNAME\n    - NOTE: the link to view the site will still be pointed to `$username.dendron.wiki`. You'll need to manually add your CNAME to see the changes\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/53de5c1e-b20c-4adc-ae48-e1659ecc6d13.html","relUrl":"notes/53de5c1e-b20c-4adc-ae48-e1659ecc6d13.html"},{"doc":"Lookup","title":"Lookup","hpath":"dendron.topic.lookup","content":"To work with notes, Dendron uses  **lookups**.

This is the `root.md`. \n\n### Domain\n\nThe domain is the root of a specific hierarchy. In our example vault, we have one domain - `dendron`.\n\n## Why Hierarchies?\n\nDendron is built around hierarchies and the axiom that a canonical hierarichal representation of notes is one of the most effective ways of managing large numbers of notes. You can read more about the thoughts behind this [here](https://kevinslin.com/organizing/its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base/).\n\n## What's with the `.`'s?\n\n1. It allows each **file** to also be a **folder**. This means your notes can have data but also contain other notes. \n2. It makes it much easier to perform certain refactoring operations. For example, say you had the following [[schema|dendron.topic.schema]]\n   ```yml\n   - id: a-parent\n   children:\n       - child-a\n       - child-b\n   - id: child-a\n   - id: child-b\n   ```\n   Lets say you wanted to make `child-b` a child of `child-a`\n   ```yml\n   - id: a-parent\n   children:\n       - child-a\n   - id: child-a\n   children:\n       - child-b\n   - id: child-b\n   ```\n    With the classical folder hierarchy, you would need to turn `child-a` into a folder and then create a custom file to hold the content from the original `child-a`\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent\n       └── child-a\n           ├── child-a-note\n           └── child-b\n   ```\n    With the `.` delimited hierarchy, this becomes a simple rename operation\n   ```\n   .\n   ├── a-parent.child-a\n   └── a-parent.child-a.child-b\n   ```\n3. It allows us to create [[stubs|dendron.topic.schema]] for parts of the hierarchy that don't exist and not clutter our file system with empty folders. With the classical folder hierarchy\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent\n       └── child-a\n           └── grandchild-a\n               └── great-grandchild-a.md\n   ```\n   With the `.` delimited hierarchy\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent.child-a.grandchild-a.great-grandchild-a.md\n   ```\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html","relUrl":"notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html"},{"doc":"Graph View","title":"Graph View","hpath":"dendron.topic.graph-view","content":"Dendron provides support for graph view using a fork of the [markdown-links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) extension. \n\nThe Dendron graph view is generated using our hierarchical index.

It was first introduced by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) and is a convenient way of adding metadata to your plaintext documents. \n\nDendron supports frontmatter. By default, we add the following keys to a new note created with Dendron:\n\n- id: a globally unique identifier for the note\n- title: your note title. used to label nodes in [[graph view|dendron.topic.graph-view]]\n- desc: optional description about your note. will show up in lookup results\n- updated: unix timestamp of when note was updated\n- created: unix timestamp of when note was created\n\nFrontmatter isn't required in Dendron and Dendron will happily index markdown files without frontmatter. Feel free to add your attributes. As long as it doesn't conflict with a Dendron builtin keyword, Dendron will leave it alone. In the future, we plan on adding a lot more functionality to the frontmatter you see in Dendron so stay tuned. \n\n# Reserved Keys\n\nNote that not all the keys are written out to the markdown file.

You can skip this initial indexing if you have a current Dendron workspace running. \n\nIn that case, the CLI can connect to the current engine instead of starting a new one using the following command. \n\n```bash\ncd {root/of/workspace}\n# .dendron.port has the port of the current running workspace\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot . --stage dev --serve --enginePort `cat .dendron.port`\n```\n\n## Pod Commands\n\n- NOTE: you can find pod ids in the [[pods|dendron.topic.pod]] page. Just add a `.import|.export` to the end of the id (eg. `dendron.pod.json.import`)\n\n### Export Pod\n\n- export a pod\n\n- eg: Export notes to JSONPod\n\n```\ndendron-cli exportPod --podId dendron.json --wsRoot . \n```\n\n### Import Pod\n\n- eg: Import notes from FilePod\n\n```\ndendron-cli importPod --podId dendron.markdown --vault \"/Users/kevinlin/Dendron-es/vault\" --podsDir /Users/kevinlin/Dendron-es/pods\n```\n\n### Publish Pod\n\n- eg: Publish a note as regular markdown\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --vault ./vault --podId dendron.markdown --noteByName dendron\n```\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/23a1b942-99af-45c8-8116-4f4bb7dccd21.html","relUrl":"notes/23a1b942-99af-45c8-8116-4f4bb7dccd21.html"},{"doc":"Capabilities","title":"Capabilities","hpath":"dendron.topic.capabilities","content":"","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/11787828-866c-48f0-9b2b-4ad4e0519698.html","relUrl":"notes/11787828-866c-48f0-9b2b-4ad4e0519698.html"},{"doc":"Snapshots","title":"Snapshots","hpath":"dendron.topic.capabilities.snapshot","content":"You can make a snapshot of your entire vault using the `Snapshot Vault` Command. \n\nThis will save all your vaults into `snapshots/{current_timestamp}`\n\n## Commands\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.commands]]#snapshot vault:#*))\n\nYou can restore your snapshots using the `Restore Vault` Command\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.commands]]#restore vault:#*))\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/4473581a-cfdf-4d98-89a9-2955b308b669.html","relUrl":"notes/4473581a-cfdf-4d98-89a9-2955b308b669.html"},{"doc":"Testimonials","title":"Testimonials","hpath":"dendron.testimonials","content":"This page is a collection of nice things that people have said about Dendron.

The biggest factors for choosing Dendron are the hierarchical structure, the multiple vaults, and the many existing VS Code extensions.\n\n> Hierarchies make a lot more sense to my brain. And some of the research I've glanced at suggests it is better for PKM than tags or other free-form structures.\n\n> Having multiple vaults made me comfortable jumping fully into Dendron. I currently have 3 separate vaults: one for my daily life & work as a librarian/journal editor, a second for my dissertation-related things, and a third that my wife & I will soon start syncing on our separate computers. I'll eventually make a fourth for notes I'll publish on my website—but this is the start of the semester, and I have to avoid that kind of exciting but time-intensive project at the moment! I appreciate that references will work between these vaults—but I don't need to worry about accidentally sharing a note with a link to \"project.kitchen-plumbing-disaster\" with my dissertation advisor, or flood my wife's computer with my reading notes and dissertation idea fragments. This fundamental separation lets me feel comfortable using one tool for all these disparate domains.\n\n> Having the full range of existing VS Code extensions for things like Pandoc, BibTeX, or Zotero, plus web development, means that I don't need to hope that someone else involved with Obsidian, Foam, etc will make a plug-in that does what I need for an edge case use. Dendron plugs into a much larger pool of people, many of whose are doing academic and web-related work. I don't do much with data analysis, but I imagine it would be nice to use VS Code tools for Python or R in the same program one uses for academic writing.\n\n- Ryan, Librarian","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/0ddffabc-c78b-4765-a3df-8ffa35dd1391.html","relUrl":"notes/0ddffabc-c78b-4765-a3df-8ffa35dd1391.html"},{"doc":"Myles","title":"Myles","hpath":"dendron.testimonials.myles","content":"\n> I started taking organised notes in 1993. I had read 'Lila' by Robert Pirsing and 'The Tao of Physics' by Fritjof Capra, both of whom used index card systems to organise those books. I've never stopped taking notes since 1993. I may have a few thousand more notes than @kevins8.\n> I've used apps - everything from Filemaker Pro, to Mark Bernstein's excellent Tinderbox, to DevonThink, to Tiddlywiki, to ones i've written myself, and dozens more, including the latest batch of 'tools for thought'. \n> Given my volume of notes over decades, I know a bit about the cul-de-sacs knowledge systems run into. I use new knowledge apps to see how they feel, but mostly studiously avoid getting stuck into complex systems and closed silos. I'm allergic to apps that are too limited for my volume and density of knowledge. I can't use Roam. I can almost use logseq. I can use dendron.\n> Kevin hid a copy of Vannevar Bush's 'As We May Think' in the dendron codebase.

Let's say I'd like to separate work and home into distinct vaults, maybe even so that other vault is a symbolic link to dropbox or whatever. Would that work? Also, what happens if there's a filename collision across vaults?\n\n## Jojo\n\nmulti-vault support is on the roadmap for this year. for naming collisions, i was thinking the following:\n\n- by default, surface all results with the vault name in the prefix\n\nsay a user has the following vaults\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── kevin-vault\n    │   └── python.hello.md\n    └── jojo-vault\n        └── python.hello.md\n```\n\nuser enters the following lookup: `python.hello`\n\nthey should see the following result\n\n```\npython.hello - kevin vault\npython.hello - jojo vault\n```\n\nwe can also introduce a vault specific prefix (eg. {vault}/{path}) to un-ambiguously specify our result\n\nuser would type `kevin-vault/python.hello` to specify they want to access `kevin-vault`\n\n\"why don't we just show all matches for an unprefixed link\" - this would work inside vscode, but if the user just publishes the workspace with conflicting vaults, I guess the link must point to some single pre-selected place(?). Also, I think the intent behind the link is to point to a single location, so asking user to fix it would probably be reasonable.\nThere's probably all kind of complex scenarios that we could envision (e.g. what if the user would like to merge domains across vaults and show all merged notes in the published page as a merged web page?), but then again 99.9% of the real cases probably just want to use multiple folders and avoid conflicts. Showing errors would probably be the easiest and still sufficient solution.\n\n### Kevin\n\ncoming back to this thread. agree with your conclusion. the other solution would be to generate a popup/intermediary page for links with multiple destinations and let the user choose.\ne\nfor v1, would bias for what you suggested and error at build time. \n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/012b49e8-7638-4856-afc2-2db3c6406a86.html","relUrl":"notes/012b49e8-7638-4856-afc2-2db3c6406a86.html"},{"doc":"Entries","title":"Entries","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n","content":"\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/167bd57c-fb54-4a71-85b2-c26ba6df29fc.html","relUrl":"notes/167bd57c-fb54-4a71-85b2-c26ba6df29fc.html"},{"doc":"Backlog","title":"Backlog","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog","content":"\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/529fb02a-3ca9-4fbc-bcba-9435f8d13e89.html","relUrl":"notes/529fb02a-3ca9-4fbc-bcba-9435f8d13e89.html"},{"doc":"Org Mode","title":"Org Mode","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.org-mode","content":"## Goals\n\nSupport org-mode sytnax within Dendron\n\n## Details\n\nThis project discusses how to best incorporate org-mode functionality into dendron\n\n## Proposals\n\n1. support {file}.org files\n2. support `org` syntax within `md` files\n\n### 1.

This can be implemented using the React Sortable Tree plugin, which will also be used for creating schemas.\n\n#### Organising the information connected to a node in a semantic and legible manner\n\nA standard graph view spreads the connected nodes arbitratily around the outside of a parent node. This is useful for understanding the general 'shape' of the connections between notes, but in order to understand the immediate connections between any particular note it is easier if they are arranged in a structured and comprehensible fashion. A view that visualises notes in a mindmap style format can achieve this.\n\n#### Activating mindmap view\n\nThe mindmap view can be triggered through the command palette as a Dendron command, as well as from an icon in the Activity Bar, or through the right-click context menu on a note. Launching it from the activity bar or command palette will launch it in the root of your vault, while launching it from the right click context menu on a note will open it focused to that particular note.\n\n#### Indication of related note\n\nWhen a note is opened from the mindmap view (or the mindmap view is opened from a note), it is linked so that navigating to other notes via the mindmap panel will open them in that same panel. This can be indicated by an icon in the menu bar of the linked panel, or an icon in the tab in the linked panel.\n\n#### Creation of new child notes by clicking\n\nA '+' icon on a note when clicked can add a child note underneath that note.\n\n#### Schema visualisation\n\nA mindmap-style visualisation lends itself to visualising the abstract concept of a schema. A note with a schema applied shows the potential nodes that it could have according to the schema as transparent notes with a '+' symbol, which when clicked will create that note.\n\n#### Expanding scope of mindmap focus\n\nThe mindmap view can also be expanded to show additional generations of notes from the same focused note (the grandparents and grandchildren of the focused note). There are '+' and '-' buttons in the mindmap view panel to increase or decrease the amount of visible generations.\n\n#### Configuration options\n\nTBD\n\n## Questions\n\n### What is the difference between this and Dendron's graph view?\n\nThe graph view shows an overview of your _entire knowledge base_ and can be traversed by scrolling and zooming. This can be useful for understand the general structure of all your notes, and the broad relationships between domains in your hierarchy but is less suited for focusing on a particular domain.\n\nThe mindmap view would allow users to focus their attention on a particular node, it's siblings, parents and children, view them in a visually organised manner, and traverse their notes by selecting notes directly attached to that domain. In this sense, it is more suited to giving you an overview of a particular _domain_.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [The Brain App](https://www.thebrain.com/)\n- [Discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126/766252142549270550)\n- [React Sortable Tree](https://github.com/mikcaweb/react-sortable-tree)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/533857a4-3dcb-478e-9877-5ab7f94ed6e6.html","relUrl":"notes/533857a4-3dcb-478e-9877-5ab7f94ed6e6.html"},{"doc":"Related","title":"Related","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.color-tabs","content":"- [github issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/261)\n\n## Goals\n\nSupport custom colorization of tabs in Dendron, specified by schema. \n\n## Details\n\nVSCode has the following settings for tabs. \n\n```\n\"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\n    \"tab.activeBackground\": \"#FFFFFF\",\n    \"tab.activeForeground\":\"#000000\",\n    \"tab.inactiveForeground\":\"#FFFFFF\",\n    \"tab.inactiveBackground\":\"#000000\",\n    \"tab.border\":\"#FFFFFF\"\n}\n```\n\nThe properties that can be customized are `activeBackground` and `inactiveBackground`.

More specific `tabColor` settings on child schemas would take precedence over parent `tabColor` settings.\n\nCurrently, the only way to set tab color is via the settings file which means Dendron would dynamically update your workspace settings as you navigate files. \n\n- [per editor/tab background color](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35379)\n- settings: \n  - workbench.colorTheme: per workspace/folder settings\n  - tab.inactiveForeground \n  - tab.inactiveBackground \n- [discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/764283816130248734)\n- [color tabs extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=orepor.color-tabs-vscode-ext)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/a4252774-0c08-4bca-a1b5-b6f369908aeb.html","relUrl":"notes/a4252774-0c08-4bca-a1b5-b6f369908aeb.html"},{"doc":"Google Calendar Pod","title":"Google Calendar Pod","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.calendar-integration","content":"## Goals\n\nSupport integrating calendars like google calendar with Dendron\n\n## Proposal\n\n- incorporate as a Google Calendar Pod\n\n### Import\n\n```yml\napiToken: \nrange: allEvents\n```\n\n### Sync\n\n```yml\n\n\n```\n\n## Publish\n\n- configuration: \n  - summary\n  - location\n  - description\n  - start\n  - end\n- not covered\n  - recurrence\n  - attendees\n  - reminders\n- flow\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/workspace\ndendron-cli dendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --vault ./vault --podId dendron.gcal --noteByName gcal.test --config /tmp/config.yml\n```\n\n### Resources\n\n- api: <https://developers.google.com/calendar/create-events>\n- sdk:\n\n```ts\n// Refer to the Node.js quickstart on how to setup the environment:\n// https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/node\n// Change the scope to 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar' and delete any\n// stored credentials.\n\nvar event = {\n  'summary': 'Google I/O 2015',\n  'location': '800 Howard St., San Francisco, CA 94103',\n  'description': 'A chance to hear more about Google\\'s developer products.',\n  'start': {\n    'dateTime': '2015-05-28T09:00:00-07:00',\n    'timeZone': 'America/Los_Angeles',\n  },\n  'end': {\n    'dateTime': '2015-05-28T17:00:00-07:00',\n    'timeZone': 'America/Los_Angeles',\n  },\n  'recurrence': [\n    'RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=2'\n  ],\n  'attendees': [\n    {'email': 'lpage@example.com'},\n    {'email': 'sbrin@example.com'},\n  ],\n  'reminders': {\n    'useDefault': false,\n    'overrides': [\n      {'method': 'email', 'minutes': 24 * 60},\n      {'method': 'popup', 'minutes': 10},\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\ncalendar.events.insert({\n  auth: auth,\n  calendarId: 'primary',\n  resource: event,\n}, function(err, event) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log('There was an error contacting the Calendar service: ' + err);\n    return;\n  }\n  console.log('Event created: %s', event.htmlLink);\n});\n\n```\n\n### Export\n\n## Flows\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/61833b7d-1cfe-4500-b78d-b30962a906cd.html","relUrl":"notes/61833b7d-1cfe-4500-b78d-b30962a906cd.html"},{"doc":"2020","title":"2020","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020","content":"\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/58247dfb-55b4-4269-9b37-42a90a0045ef.html","relUrl":"notes/58247dfb-55b4-4269-9b37-42a90a0045ef.html"},{"doc":"Server Migration","title":"Server Migration","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration","content":"## Goals\n\nMigrate the Dendron to (local) client &lt;-> server architecture\n\n## Details\n\nDendron's current architecture can be found [here](https://dendron.so/notes/c160ddce-edec-4f6e-841b-418d6030fa37.html). Currently, all of Dendron's indexing capabilities is provided by the `dendron engine` as a library which is included in every extension that uses it. This has many drawbacks - every extension re-indexes all notes and also blocks the client (vscode) during this process.\n\nThe Dendron server migration is to move Dendron to a client server architecture. Note that the migration will involve standing up **two servers**: one for language server functionality (the lsp server), and another for dendron's [lookup](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html) capabilities (the express server). \n\nThe rationale for having two servers is discussed [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/748936364283920495/759153642644701285).\n\nThey are also elaborated upon [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/765435624878505985)\n\nInstead of calling the engine directly, the Dendron extension, as well as related plugins, will communicate to Dendron's server using IPC and on local ports. \n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] add LSP server to Dendron (0.12)\n- [x] add api server to Dendron (0.12)\n- [x] hook server into dendron startup (0.12.4)\n- [x] migrate lookup to server model \n  - [x] support query notes (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support query notes with schema (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support write notes (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support write note with schema (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support delete note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support query schema (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support write schema (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support delete schema  (0.12.7)\n- [x] optimize server lookup performance (0.12.7)\n- [x] enable file watcher (0.12.7)\n- [x] dendron tree view (0.12.7)\n- [x] migrate commands\n  - [x] scratch note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] copy note command (0.12.7)\n  - [x] copy note url (0.12.7)\n  - [x] lookup scratch note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] lookup journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] global journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] build pod (0.12.8)\n  - [x] rename note\n  - [x] archive hierarchy\n  - [x] refactor hiearchy\n  - [x] doctor\n- [x] integration tests for all server functionality\n\n## Next\n\n- migrate bundled extensions to server model\n- use custom goto definition provider \n- use custom backlink definition provider\n- use schema based completions\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo enable server mode, update the following setting in your workspace settings `\"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport\": true`.

While both characteristics matter, we agree to make these tradeoffs when necessary. \n\n- function over form    \n  - in dendron, its more important for something to be useful than it is to be beautiful \n  - the focus in dendron should be about your content and the hierarchies that connect them\n- focus on speed\n  - we can't predict the future but its likely that no one will ever say that they wish their note taking experience to be slower\n  - when thinking about features and tool chain, bias for speed\n- focus on hierarchies\n  - while dendron supports backlinks and other forms of organizing notes, dendron's foundation is tooling to help you manage hierarchies\n- retrieval over insertion @kpathakota\n\n## Related\n\n- [[dendron.principles]]\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/35d7d7bc-64a6-4850-9a54-7de7f43ad751.html","relUrl":"notes/35d7d7bc-64a6-4850-9a54-7de7f43ad751.html"},{"doc":"Power functionality v0","title":"Power functionality v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.power-functionality","content":"## Goals\n\nSupport power user functionality \n\n## Details\n\nTBD\n\n## Tasks\n\n- schemas\n  - [ ] [specify sections within notes](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/248)\n\n## Next\n\nTBD\n\n## Links\n\n- [project docs](https://dendron.so/notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/pro.power-func-v0)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html","relUrl":"notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html"},{"doc":"Pods v0","title":"Pods v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.pods","content":"## Goal\n\nMake it possible for people to import/export their data between Dendron and **any other** platform that contains information a user might care about.\t\n\n## Details\n\nDendron wants to be your **central digital nervous system** - our end goal is to be the **best possible way** to create, build, use, and share the knowledge that matters to you. \t\nTo do that effectively, we believe its important that you have **full control of your information**. This means having your data available in plaintext markdown and having an note-taking tool that is local and open source. But we want to go further than that which is where [pods](TODO) come in. \t\nDendron refers to a pod as anything you could conceivably use to store/publish notes. Evernote, Roam, static websites, twitter - any and all of these things are potential pods. The vision with pods is that you should be able to seamlessly move **your information** in and out a pod and in and out of Dendron. \t\n\nUnlike what the [notion](https://www.notion.so/) marketing folks might tell you, we don't believe there is a one size fits all approach when it comes to knowledge management, a concept that includes collecting articles, project management, journaling, collaboration, and basically any workflows that involve working with information.\t\n\nWhile Dendron will make it possible for you to do these things, it will also help you move your information to tools that do it better for a given use case. Imagine being able to collaborate on a note using [google docs](https://docs.google.com/), use the spreadsheet functionality in [airtable](https://airtable.com/) to organize and all the while keep a canonical copy of that note inside Dendron where it is just a lookup away. \t\n\nIf you have ideas about pods and pod related workflows that you would like to see us build, please come discuss them with us in our newly created [#pods](https://discord.gg/8vjasHj) channel. \t\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] establish basic pod framework\n- [x] use pods via extension\n- [x] use pods via CLI\n- [x] create 2 pods\n- [ ] support custom pods\n- [ ] document pods\n\n## Next\n\n- community voting on pods\n- stabilize pod API\n\n## Links\n\n- [project docs](https://dendron.so/notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/pro.pods-v0)\n\n## Related\n\n- [[dendron.topic.pod]]\n- [[pod proposal issue|dendron.roadmap.project.scratch.2020.09.07-164009]]\t\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html","relUrl":"notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html"},{"doc":"Multi Vault Support","title":"Multi Vault Support","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault","content":"## Goals\n\nUsers should be able to create multiple vaults for a given workspace. Each vault is a folder that can contain any number of hierarchies. \n\n## Use Cases\n\n- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox \n- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context\n- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`\n- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault\n\n## Concepts\n\n![[dendron.concepts#workspace:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#vaults:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#hierarchies:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#domain:#*]]\n\n## Specs\n\n- a workspace can have one or more vaults\n- a workspace can have one or more workspace configs\n- vaults have a path relative to the workspace and an optional name\n  <!-- - the initial vault is called `main` -->\n  <!-- - vaults can be referred to by name using the `$` prefix  -->\n\n## Flow\n\n### Initialization\n\nTo facilitate separation and re-usability of vaults, we are changing how the initial workspace is laid out in Dendron.\n\nToday, all files (configuration, vaults, docs) are located directly inside the **workspace root**.\n\n((ref:[[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for legacy workspace,1:#*))\n\nWith multivault, workspace configuration  will be moved underneath a separate folder underneath the **configuration root**. By default, this will inside a folder named **config**.\n\n((ref:[[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for multi-vault workspace,1:#*))\n\nInside a multi-vault workspace, each vault and config will be initialized as separate and independent git repositories. To initialize a multi-vault workspace, you can run `Dendorn: Initialize MultiVault Workspace` to bootstrap the folder layout that you see above. \n\nWe will also be releasing a migration script that can convert a single vault workspace into a multi-vault workspace. \n\n### Configuration\n\nThe `dendron.yml` file will be modified to have additional metadata for vaults that have remote repositories associated with them. A remote root is not required unless you plan on cloning your workspace to other computers. \n\n```yml\nvaults:\n  - fsPath: vault1\n    remote:\n      type: git\n      url: /path/to/vault1/repo\n  - fsPath: vault2\n    remote:\n      type: git\n      url: /path/to/vault2/repo\n      branch: nightly # optional, target specific branch\n```\n\n### Cloning\n\nCloning is the act of checking out a workspace on another machine. To clone, Dendron will have the `Dendron: Clone Workspace` command. It will take the url of a remote **workspace configuration** repo as input as well as a local path for the **workspace root**. Cloning will checkout the _workspace configuration_ underneath the _workspace root_ and also checkout all the vaults that are associated with the configuration underneath the workspace.\n\n### Add a new Vault\n\n- run `Dendron: Add Vault`\n  - specify file path relative to the current **workspace root**\n  - specify an optional user friendly name for the vault\n    - if no name is set, the last component of the file path will be used\n- when the user hits enter, the vault is created as an \"empty vault\"\n  - empty vaults will contain a `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` file\n\n### Lookup\n\n((ref:[[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for multi-vault workspace,1:#*))\n\n- lookup: {empty query}\n  - show all top level results of all vaults. note how the vault name shows up in parenthesis next to the result\n  - results\n    ```\n    root (vault1)\n    root (vault2)\n    foo (vault1)\n    foo (vault2)\n    ```\n- lookup: `vault1/`\n  - by prefixing lookup with the vault name, you can narrow results to a particular vault\n  - results\n    ```\n    root (vault1)\n    foo (vault1)\n    ```\n- lookup: `foo.`\n  - dendron will merge all results from all vaults when you do a lookup\n  - results\n    ```\n    foo.one (vault2)\n    foo.two (vault1)\n    ```\n- lookup: `foo.new`\n  - when you lookup a note that doesn't exist, you'll have the option of creating the note in either vault\n  - results\n    ```\n    Create New (vault2)\n    Create New (vault1)\n    ```\n\n### Navigating Links\n\n((ref:[[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for multi-vault workspace,1:#*))\n\n- navigating  to `[[foo]]` will result in a display prompting the user to select the vault to navigate to \n  - the UI should be similar to the **Peek Action**\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-10-19-20-48-52.png)\n\n- navigating to `[[foo.two]]` will directly navigate to the note since it is unique across all vaults\n\n- navigating to `[[vault1/foo]]` will open foo in vault1 \n\n### Moving Notes Between Vaults\n\n- TBD\n\n### Publishing Notes\n\n((ref:[[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#file layout for multi-vault workspace,1:#*))\n\n- configuration to publish everything under foo\n  - config\n    ```yml\n    vaults:\n    - name: main\n        path: vault1\n    - name: private\n        path: vault2\n    publish:\n        siteHierarchies: [foo] \n    ```\n  - published notes:\n    ```\n    vault1/foo.md\n    vault1/two.md\n    vault2/foo.md\n    vault2/one.md\n    ```\n\n\n- configuration that denies publication from vault2\n  - config\n    ```yml\n    vaults:\n    - name: main\n        path: vault1\n    - name: private\n        path: vault2\n        allowPublish: false\n    publish:\n        siteHierarchies: [foo] \n    ```\n  - published notes:\n    ```\n    vault1/foo.md\n    vault1/two.md\n    ```\n\n## Special Cases\n\n### Adding a vault under another vault\n\n- you want to put all notes from `vault2` under `vault1` under the `vault2` node\n- eg: lookup should see the following hierarchy\n\n```\n├── foo.md\n├── foo.two.md\n├── vault2.foo.md\n└── vault2.foo.one.md\n```\n\nThis can be achieved with the following config\n\n```yml\nvaults:\n- name: main\n    path: vault1\n- name: private\n    path: vault2\n    mountUnder: vault2\n```\n\n## Reference\n\n### File Layout for Legacy Workspace\n\n```\n.\n└── Dendron\n    ├── .git\n    ├── dendron.code-workspace\n    ├── dendron.yml\n    ├── docs \n    ├── pods\n    ├── vault1\n    │   ├── foo.md\n    │   └── foo.two.md\n    └── vault2\n        ├── foo.md\n        └── foo.one.md\n```\n\n### File Layout for Multi-Vault Workspace\n\n```\n.\n└── Dendron\n    |── .git\n    |── dendron.code-workspace\n    |── dendron.yml\n    |── pods\n    |── docs\n    ├── vault1\n    │   |── .git\n    │   ├── foo.md\n    │   └── foo.two.md\n    └── vault2\n        |── .git\n        ├── foo.md\n        └── foo.one.md\n```\n\n<!-- ```\n.\n└── Dendron\n    ├── config\n    │   |── .git\n    │   |── dendron.code-workspace\n    │   └── dendron.yml\n    │   └── pods\n    │   └── docs\n    ├── vault1\n    │   |── .git\n    │   ├── foo.md\n    │   └── foo.two.md\n    └── vault2\n        |── .git\n        ├── foo.md\n        └── foo.one.md\n``` -->\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### vaults\n\n- top level directive in `dendron.yml`\n- collection of one or more vaults\n\n#### {vault}.name\n\n- name of vault\n\n#### {vault}.path\n\n- path to vault\n\n#### {vault}.mountUnder\n\n**NOTE**: this is not implemented yet\n\n- optional\n- by default, all hierarchies are mounted at the root\n- you change this by adding a mountpoint which is equivalent of adding a **prefix** to all files within the vault\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [project docs](https://dendron.so/notes/45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/pro.multi-vault)\n\n## Discussions\n\n- [[name collision thread|dendron.roadmap.project.scratch.2020.09.07-121834]]\n- [[sharing materials between vaults|dendron.roadmap.project.scratch.2020.09.07-121952]]\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e.html","relUrl":"notes/45cfb9f2-46cf-4f67-a41e-834818fbd06e.html"},{"doc":"Long term sustainability v0","title":"Long term sustainability v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.long-term-sustainability","content":"## Goals\n\nFigure out and experiment with a long term business model for Dendron.\n\n## Details\n\n[Kevin](https://github.com/kevinslin) is the founder of Dendron and working on it full time.

To reference a header, use `![[note#foo]]`. This changes makes our note ref syntax more consistent with our wiki link syntax. \n\nNote that the new ref syntax expects a [[sluggified|dendron.ref.terms#slug]] header. This is done automatically when you use the updated [[copy note ref|dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref]] command. \n\nThis change makes it possible to create a ref to a header with special characters.\n\nThe old syntax ref syntax will still work but should now be considered deprecated. We will release a `doctor` command to help you auto-upgrade from the old syntax to the new syntax in the coming week.\n\n#### Frontmatter Variable Substitution\n\nIt is now possible to use variables defined in your note frontmatter inside your note. The syntax is `{{fm.VAR_NAME}}` where `VAR_NAME` is the name of your variable. The `fm` designates that you want to use a frontmatter variable. \n\n<!-- \n#### Publishing V2 Integration with Plugin\n\nYou can now both build your notes for publication and preview it from inside vscode. \n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#site-build:#dev]]\n-->\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- `nav_exclude` property excludes from nav sider and table of contents ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing.navigation#nav-exclude]])\n- [[copy note ref|dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref]] command will use the new note ref syntax\n- footnote support in preview and when publishing ([[docs|dendron.topic.markdown#footnotes]])\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- spaces in wiki link not rendering in preview\n\n## 0.22.2\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- better fuzzy search for lookup\n- publishing v2 enhancements\n  - abbreviation support for 11ty publishing ([[docs|dendron.topic.markdown#abbreviation]])\n  - better note titles ([[docs|dendron.ref.titles]])\n  - shrink size of published page 10x\n  - fix left nav position of current active page\n  - ability to override output folder from CLI when building site\n  - don't throw error on code blocks that are unsupported by prismjs\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- markdown preview delay in showing newly created notes\n- `buildSiteV2` not connect to running workspace\n\n## 0.22.1\n\n### Features\n\n- [[Collections|dendron.topic.publishing.collections]] support for 11ty\n  - publish blog like archives using Dendron\n- CLI Based Doctor ([[docs|dendron.topic.cli#doctor]])\n  - run various tests to make your notes are healthy for the new year\n- use frontmatter as title when publishing and in the preview ([[docs|dendron.topic.config#usefmtitle]])\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- additional metadata tags for published pages\n- support `noindex` option ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#noindex]])\n- add anchor links to headers\n- use note title for page title\n- support [[nav_exclude|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#nav_exclude]] option\n- support overriding [[output|dendron.topic.cli#buildsitev2]] in `buildSiteV2` command\n- don't throw error if no syntax highlighter available for code block\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- issue connecting to open workspace using CLI\n- nav bar when publishing multiple hierarchies will show wrong expansion options\n\n## 0.21.2\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- build-site command can connect to current running workspace ([[docs|dendron.topic.cli#connect-to-open-workspace]])\n- support inline math when publishing\n- support block math when publishing \n- support rendering gfm inside note reference when publishing\n- support anchor headings when publishing\n- support relative links when publishing\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- issue with displaying math in preview\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- the code highlighter has been changed from `prismjs` to `highligher.js`\n\n## 0.21.1\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- add seo tags ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#seo-options]])\n- enable edit on github link ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#github-options]])\n- migrate all jekyll `_config.yml` settings to `dendron.yml`\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- build-site errors when building from vaults without `asset folder`\n- build-site error on certain operating systems\n- build-site error on node version != 12\n\n### Docs\n\n- [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) is now published using the new 11ty framework\n- add [[publishing to github guide|dendron.topic.publishing.github]] using github actions\n\n## 0.20.2\n\n### Features\n\n#### Publishing For Multi Vault\n\n![[dendron.topic.multi-vault#publishing:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- creating engine via cli also initializes meta files ([d72f097](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d72f097e63d1fda065ac7ad50f85bebe99d6da66))([[docs|dendron.topic.cli#launchengineserver]])\n- remove github light theme from dendron bundle ([33d5708](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/33d57086510cdaefbb8af8f72c945d6f5e02be5c))\n- support [[note refs for multi-vault|dendron.topic.multi-vault#note-references]] \n- support relative links in dendron preview ([[docs|dendron.topic.links#wiki-links]])\n- further speed enhancements to publishing using 11ty resulting in another 5x improvement  \n- configure [[writeStubs|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#writestubs-optional]] from `dendron.yml`\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- refactor hierarchy miss self referential links ([00b385d](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/00b385dd0d13e5809da012bbc88388886012b837))\n- reduce frequency of `engine not connecting` error when launching dendron preview\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- [[writeStubs|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#writestubs-optional]] is set to `true` by default (or when not set) when publishing using 11ty\n\n## 0.20.1\n\n### Publishing V2 (preview)\n\nWe've re-build publishing for Dendron from the ground up to be faster, better, and easier to use.\n\nBesides for schemas, publishing has consistently been one of the hardest to use features in Dendron. Dendron currently publishes using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using our own [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). While this has served as well initially, slow compile times for large sites and difficulty of getting started has made it a growing pain point.\n\nTo address this, we've migrated our publishing stack to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a super fast javascript based static generator. This means much faster, and perhaps more importantly, easier publishing. \n\nThere's still some work left to integrate publishing into the Dendron plugin - meanwhile, you can take the new publishing workflow for a spin using the [[dendron cli|dendron.topic.cli]]\n\nIn order to to use the 11ty based publishing, initialize your workspace with the following commands.\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty@latest\n```\n\nAfter you have your dependencies installed, build your your site using the following command.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage dev --serve\n```\n\nThis will both compile your site locally and make it available at `localhost:8080` for instant preview. When building your site locally, the pages will be build to `{wsRoot}/build/site`. \n\nWhen you are ready to publish to github, make sure to change the stage to `prod`.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage prod \n```\n\nThis will build your site to the path specified by [[siteRootDir|dendron.topic.publishing-legacy.configuration#siterootdir]] in `dendron.yml`. \n\n#### Benchmarks\n\nPublishing V2 is ~10x faster than jekyll based publishing for sites with +100 pages. For comparison, below is the compilation difference between building the dendron site using 11ty vs jekyll. \n\n- 11ty: 24.45s\n- jekyll: 220.33s\n\nThere are additional optimizations still on the table that will further drive down he compilation time by another order of magnitude for future releases. \n\n#### Gaps\n\n11ty publishing is currently not at full feature parity with Jekyll publishing. Notably, the following features are missing:\n\n- setting a custom color theme\n- `edit on github` links\n- `jekyll-seo` functionality\n- mathjax\n\n#### Migration\n\nAll values that used to be written into `_config.yml` will now be moved into `dendron.yml`. You can see the currently supported configuration values here: `https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types.ts#L71:L71`\n\nIf you currently have a Jekyll based Dendron page, note that the following settings have changed:\n\n- the `url` property from `_config.yml` is now `siteUrl` in `dendron.yml`\n- favicon is now controlled by `siteFaviconPath` in `dendron.yml` and is a path relative to your workspace root\n- `CNAME` is now controlled by `githubCname` property in `dendron.yml`\n\n#### Sample dendron.yml config\n\n- publishing without a cname\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    siteUrl: \"kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test\"\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n```\n\n- using custom cname\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    siteUrl: \"11ty.dendron.so\"\n    githubCname: \"11ty.dendron.so\"\n```\n\n#### Sample repo\n\n- [github repo](https://github.com/kevinslin/dendron-11ty-test/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)\n- [github page](https://kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test/)\n\n#### CLI Command Reference\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli buildSiteV2\n\nbuild notes for publication using 11ty\n\nOptions:\n  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]\n  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]\n  --wsRoot   location of workspace                                    [required]\n  --vaults   location of vault                                           [array]\n  --serve    serve over local http server             [boolean] [default: false]\n  --stage    serve over local http server\n```\n\n<!-- https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/10/to-eleventy-and-beyond/ -->\n\n## Past Releases\n\n- [[0.1.X|dendron.release.changelog.0-1-x]]\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/9bc92432-a24c-492b-b831-4d5378c1692b.html","relUrl":"notes/9bc92432-a24c-492b-b831-4d5378c1692b.html"},{"doc":"Early Seed","title":"Early Seed","hpath":"dendron.release.changelog.early-seed","content":"## 0.30.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Custom Pods\n\nWe now have custom pod support\n![[dendron.topic.pod.custom#summary,1:#*]]\n\nIf you are interested in developing your own publishing pod, you can docs to do so [[here|dendron.topic.pod.dev]]\n\n#### Dev.to Pod\n\nAs an example of what you can do with a custom pod, we created the [[Dev.to Pod|dendron.pro.devto-pod]] which lets you publish your notes to dev.to\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- backlinks in published sites \n\n![[dendron.topic.publishing.features#backlinks,1]]\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- delete node sometimes fails in multi-vault\n- publishing multi-vault will sometimes not work if multiple domain notes\n- unable to select `root` of multi-vault notes in tree view\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- if you're working on the codebase, `dendron.code-workspace` has been renamed to `dendron-main.code-workspace`\n  - this helps if you're working on dendron while having dendron installed since Dendron, prior to this change, would also activate when you were editing the code\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/3abd00eb-1c1e-4253-aaf5-dcbe20c21850.html","relUrl":"notes/3abd00eb-1c1e-4253-aaf5-dcbe20c21850.html"},{"doc":"-01.x","title":"-01.x","hpath":"dendron.release.changelog.1x","content":"\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/b7b8292e-18d2-4f28-91bf-036da5699b13.html","relUrl":"notes/b7b8292e-18d2-4f28-91bf-036da5699b13.html"},{"doc":"0.1.X","title":"0.1.X","hpath":"dendron.release.changelog.0-1-x","content":"## 0.19.3\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- be able to name remote vaults ([6da3973](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/6da39730f735f4700479f002f57d2a7802398ff5))\n- doctor command shouldn't create stubs ([e812f34](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e812f34246d88b007fb45ca03443a74ac27a5e62))\n- help command not working ([02fc08a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/02fc08a907e196b39c23db36b82565c15588673f))\n- nested git repos not showing up in source control view ([37adc5e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/37adc5e528e0b9fa6c86105b39ebb40384023da4))\n- clicking a stub on tree view would show a false error ([ea0e17e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ea0e17e7ec8afed44cee1fd0fe442ba4c2064f92))\n\n## 0.19.2\n\n### Features\n\n#### Dendron Seed Bank\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.seed-bank]]))\n\n#### Support refactor for multi-vault\n\nOne of our most requested features for multi-vault is now out. Refactor will now work across multiple vaults. All rename operations take place in the same vault as the file being renamed (so a refactor operation that affects files in multiple vaults will end up renaming files within each vault). You can see an example of this below:\n\n```\n.\n├── vault1\n│   └── bond.one\n└── vault2\n    └── bond.two\n```\n\n- after refactoring `bond -> james`\n\n```\n.\n├── vault1\n│   └── james.one\n└── vault2\n    └── james.two\n```\n\n#### Support Specifying Vault Location when Creating a Note\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.multi-vault]]#specify vault location when creating a note,1:#*))\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- add aws to the seed bank ([818bc05](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/818bc0510e3b3b99057ef7cda8d9c61be2b6ebc6))\n- nicer refactor formatting ([0e7749a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0e7749a175a0ce80903cde5c9773649779100a9c))\n- add remote vault to gitignore if exist ([1c252db](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1c252db60c0ea69be8dd10c1768c2dd302711e13))\n- initialize all remote vaults on startup ([1919fe4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1919fe4e6d853d1f6ef63564ebbcc9af1e11a41a))\n- write remote url to dendron config ([2a285ea](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/2a285eacaeef8224d2a3530dc991b4977443c039))\n- add github sponsor badge on github repository to recruit more [[environmentalists|dendron.community.roles#environmentalist]] 👨‍🌾 👩‍🌾\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- completion on schema suggestions ([223d6a5](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/223d6a501bd9e51331d28e21d77408b7ca3fba50))\n\n## 0.19.1\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- image preview regex match wrong range \n\n## 0.18.2\n\n### Features\n\n- support image hover ([8fee313](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8fee313785dfc4ac2564f74911a4b51879be0673))\n\n  ```\n  - you can now hover over markdown image links and get the image preview\n  ```\n\n  <div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/82119bc9ee184e3ca8e619c3d7e48209\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- faster completion ([d9d4598](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d9d4598c1996fdb5eb24e4bda0e51e777b476f6e))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- doctor errors when backfilling frontmatter ([862e917](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/862e9173e92a2e5d964273bb87c19e79177a6200))\n- properly parsing links that start at beginning of line ([b2dbdfc](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/b2dbdfc9e49aa1fa74d5097500eeaddf05bf7ccc))\n- limit completion prompts to inside wiki links ([f49972e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f49972ee436f9f637bd68729e702ba2169e68faf))\n- adding local vault with fail if using relative path ([fb202e9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/fb202e91e501cfd5506fd73c9a005807954e48d3))\n- make completion match the whole link ([d9d4598](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d9d4598c1996fdb5eb24e4bda0e51e777b476f6e))\n- tree view containing out of date hierarchy\n- alias notes will no longer display alias portion as part of the link when publishing\n\n## 0.18.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Support adding remote vaults\n\n- commit: ([d7501b9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d7501b9a5cb116faae64d26798cfd7ccfc73a4b0))\n\nYou can now natively add published Dendron git repos as a _remote vault_ inside Dendron. These vaults are stored in a custom `repos` folder underneath your `workspaceRoot`. Since a remote vault is just a git repo, you are able to perform all the usual git operations on it like `push`, `pull`, `merge`, and `blame`. \n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/ef3fa948460c4f2cb4f7a7b8242579d1\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- support pods for multi-vault ([661fe21](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/661fe218d448e6f32f86bf60dabe635b71d67251))\n- much faster lookup performance for large vaults 🚀🚀🚀  ([3ddeba8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/3ddeba8a596be4bc9316e0cc5e63025d7bf4460f))\n- support [[sibling nav|dendron.topic.commands#go-next-sibling]] for multi-vault ([235bfc7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/235bfc77505b403bf32c78ce3df6b7005c37dfba))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- publishing fails in some cases when multi-vault is enabled ([0ebac81](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0ebac8191291f48ab42fbc30279e9615c96a5245))\n- journal and scratch notes fail in some cases for multi-vault ([5c04ccd](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/5c04ccd666511abb79554b7a24c02efd46d93c3a))\n- multiple commands not working properly for multi-vault([fd5a381](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/fd5a381674384588850b07b193fc0bf609abc0fd))\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- breaking: the [[go to sibling|dendron.topic.commands#go-next-sibling]] commands have a new keyboard shortcut since the old one was conflicting with the vscode default. the new shortcuts are `ctrl+shift+]` and `ctrl+shift+[`\n\n## 0.17.2\n\n### Features\n\n#### Dendron Web UI 🚧\n\nDuring office hours and onboardings, many of you said how you loved Dendron's functionality but wished that it was a little easier to use, especially on the UI front.\n\nThis is why I'm excited to introduce Dendron's first Web UI - an interface build using modern web technologies integrated into VSCode. \n\nThis initial launch features the Dendron Configuration editor. Prior to the UI, you would have to manually edit YAML to update the configuration. With the web ui, you no longer have to understand YAML and your changes will be validated before being saved. \n\nThe configuration editor is just the first step in making Dendron easier to use and expect to see more updates on this front soon.\n\nNote that the Web UI is still deemed experimental and functionality like keyboard shortcuts currently don't work.\n\nSpecial thanks to [Tyler Nieman](https://github.com/tsnieman) for the UI work!\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.commands]]#configure,1:#*))\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- update config commands ([44dce76](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/44dce76b6fd447cd29a2f4f594632ef758eff927))\n- enable rename with multi-vault ([e26b294](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e26b294e8bbe1e49e44318152c247595e82639bb))\n- tree view and backlinks panel no longer appear when Dendron is not active (thank you [Christopher Corley](https://github.com/cscorley))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- rename would fail if backlink existed at root note\n- numerous fixes to refactor hierarchy\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- the `Dendron: Configure` command will now launch the config editor with the web ui\n- the old `Dendron: Configure` command as been renamed to `Dendron: Configure (yaml)`\n\n## 0.17.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Automatic Hover's for Links\n\n- add hover provider ([8d19a1b](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8d19a1b47f114ae738f7483fd751b62f68b46d24))\n\nYou can now preview notes and references inside the editor as a hover without ever opening the link.

Multi Vault lets you add additional [vaults](https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#vaults-) to your Dendron workspace.\n\nEach vault is logically separate (they reside in separate directories) but can be universally queried using lookup.\n\nMulti vault enables a bunch of exciting use cases.\n\n((ref:[[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]#use cases,1:#*))\n\nCurrently, the following commands are supported with multi-vault:\n\n- Lookup \n- Deleting a Note\n- Navigating to a note using Tree View \n\nOther commands like rename/refactor will still work when performed in your primary vault. They will probably not work if performed against a note not inside your primary vault.\n\nWhen you use **Lookup** to create a new note with multi vault, the note will be created inside the same vault as the current opened note. **Lookup** will also show you the vault that each note belongs to while performing lookup.\n\nCurrently known issues (with supported commands):\n\n- unable to create a note using Lookup that has the same name as an existing note inside **any** of your vaults \n- unable to navigating to the root of a vault using Tree View\n\n#### Vault Add Command\n\nAdd a new vault to your workspace. \n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n#### Vault Remove Command\n\nRemove a vault from your workspace. Note that the underlying files wil **not** be deleted - the vault will lose its association with your workspace.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/307effc22b8d4c59a32933529a8393e1\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **engine:** init with empty config won't throw error ([7beb90f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/7beb90fa243bc73563a3ce16b5305345f7348d9f))\n- **engine:** don't delete old note if new note wasn't created by rename ([de44f9f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/de44f9f4d38651d75433ae885fdc78bb762fb1f6))\n- **notes:** fix issue when importing note that already exists ([a08a34a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a08a34a0563bb4047bd9c7cfc5f2bf150873fdc8))\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- vault metadata will be added to `dendron.yml`\n- `dendron.yml` comments will be stripped on workspace initialization\n\n## 0.15.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Wildcard Note Ref Links\n\n- **refs:** wildcard note ref links ([98a1177](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/98a117715a967492ab9d7b8749d964b07bde4055))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.refs]]#wildcard note refs,1))\n\n#### Dendron: Configure Command\n\n- **workbench:** add configure command ([db51dc3](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/db51dc35864d0c4434f70620ef0e88451c198fa4))\n\nThis is a quick way to update the `dendron.yml` file. You can run it by using `Dendron: Configure`\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **notes:** fix issue when importing note that already exists ([a08a34a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/a08a34a0563bb4047bd9c7cfc5f2bf150873fdc8))\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- add `.dendron.ws` file under workspace to store workspace specific metadata\n\n## 0.14.2\n\n### Features\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **pods:** better markdown import pod  (d1eaa264)\n  - address multiple edge cases that would cause import pod to fail\n  - auto-convert wiki-links from folder-based systems like obsidian into dendron\n- **cli:** launch engine server using cli ([25eae3f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/25eae3fddd6a2d26dcf9e2f3e664b377c2cca978))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.cli]]#launchengineserver:#*))\n\n- **workspace:** write server port in workspace ([6a0ff84](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/6a0ff845ebbf010073b271123779fc3f56ac2821))\n  - used by bundled extensions to talk to dendron server\n- **engine:** add sync method ([ec58d39](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ec58d395003640384b7764f4f8b483429cc1ece3))\n  - used by bundled extensions to talk to dendron server\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **engine:** properly handle \\* in refs when refactoring ([704a14f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/704a14f17196e18cb5b26f5fc98ed9f8d492e16a))\n- **workbench:** fix daily journal note command signature ([5ec96ef](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/5ec96efd9a006e5e5999f2704dfb3d1e97e60a5c))\n\n## [0.14.1](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.14.1-alpha.7...v0.14.1) (2020-11-05)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Lookup Copy WikiLink Modifier\n\n- **lookup:** copy note link cmd ([e38743d](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e38743ddbac8486f2ac778bd546a6373a15a4f6d))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]]#copywikilink,1:#*))\n\n#### Lookup Multi-Select Modifier\n\n- **lookup:** support multi-select ([b409c05](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/b409c05d3b19797de714dbf10b6a4249758eae8a))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]]#multiselect,1:#*))\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n#### Code Cleanup\n\nWith the server migration behind us, we took some time to make Dendron more hygenic by removing old code and consolidating existing code. All in all, we eliminated ~8k lines. If you are currently working on a branch, I suggest you merge with master to get the latest changes 😅 \n\n- before cleanup\n\n```\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage                     files          blank        comment           code\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJSON                            73              6              0          72744\nTypeScript                     246           3089           3089          31790\nMarkdown                        50           4682              0           5947\nJavaScript                      16            168             76           1349\nBourne Shell                    23             40              9            179\nYAML                            13              3              3            158\nCSS                              2             17             32             72\nHTML                             1              0              0             14\nSVG                              1              0              0             12\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUM:                           425           8005           3209         112265\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n- after cleanup\n\n```\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage                     files          blank        comment           code\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJSON                            73              6              0          72745\nTypeScript                     224           2343           1810          24352\nMarkdown                        34           4772              0           5974\nJavaScript                      16            168             76           1349\nBourne Shell                    24             40              9            181\nYAML                             6              3              3             78\nCSS                              2             17             32             72\nHTML                             1              0              0             14\nSVG                              1              0              0             12\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUM:                           381           7349           1930         104777\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n## 13.6\n\n### Features\n\n#### Add Contribute Command\n\n- **workbench:** ([130a58a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/130a58a62cc40eb4178afac554f8f4ff30c93055))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.commands]]#contribute:#*))\n\n#### Add Snapshot Capability to Dendron\n\n- **workbench:**  ([3af64b7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/3af64b701d47ed28818d7e6017c758f63be617f0))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.capabilities.snapshot]]#Snapshots:#*))\n\n## [0.13.5](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.4...v0.13.5) (2020-10-28)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **workbench:** tree view can delete notes with caps ([d37926d](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d37926d7f38d784f847a4c2a58fb75ba7c03b0e0))\n\n## [0.13.4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.13.4-alpha.1...v0.13.4) (2020-10-28)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Migrate Existing Workspaces to Server Mode\n\n- commit ([d19b6ec](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d19b6ecb97fb60d8706e14f0181795113b5e108b))\n\nThis is the last phase in Dendron's server mode migration. All new workspaces are already running in server mode as well as well as users that have opted into it. This update transparently migrates remaining workspaces to server mode. \n\nAs a reminder, [[server mode|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] is a re-architecture of Dendron that enables both better performance and a vast array of new features. \n\nFinally, we do have an escape valve in things something goes terribly wrong. You can set the following option to revert server mode behavior.

This turns out to be an anti-pattern that interferes with features like publishing which expect the workspace to be in a separate folder from its vaults.\n\n##

[0.12.9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.9-alpha.1...v0.12.9) (2020-10-15)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Human Friendly Timestamps (server mode)\n\nTimestamps now have human friendly decorators on the side.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/daily.ts.jpg)\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **copyAssets configuration**: when publishing, you can now toggle whether you want to copy assets or not\n- **dump state**: dendron now has a `Dump State` command which will dump the internal state into the logs (useful for debugging)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **assets not being copied:** assets not copied on publishing when `assetsPrefix` was set\n- **GoUp comman go to wrong note (server mode):** GoUp would sometimes try to open a stub node which would result in an error\n- **Multiple workspaces result in bad timestamps (server mode):** Having multiple workspaces of the same vaults open could result in bad timestamps\n\n### Documentation\n\n((ref:[[dendron.guides.troubleshooting]]#error upgrading:#*))\n\n## [0.12.8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.8-alpha.2...v0.12.8) (2020-10-14)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Really update time in frontmatter (server only)\n\nDendron notes have frontmatter with an **updated** field. This field is supposed to show you the time in milliseconds of when the document was last updated. Until today's update, this field did not actually change  😅\n\n```\nid: 65b03213-d3d1-46c0-9881-a6280ed9bdeb\ntitle: New\ndesc: ''\nupdated: 1602096212957\ncreated: 1602096212957\n```\n\nToday's update makes **updated** update! \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **support BuildPod command (server mode)**: build pod now works when server mode is enabled\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **navigating to special notes**: scratch/journal notes could fail to open if note already exists\n\n### Other\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.extensions]]#useful extensions))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.guides.tips]]#copy and paste web content into dendron:#*))\n\n((ref:[[dendron.guides.cook]]#mobile support:#*))\n\n## [0.12.7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.7-alpha.10...v0.12.7) (2020-10-13)\n\n### Features\n\n#### (Local) Server Side Indexing\n\nDendron can now index and manage your notes as a standalone **local** server independent from VSCode. \n\nThis is part of the [[server migration milestone|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] which we took on for October. \n\nDendron's server side indexing is a **complete rewrite** of the [[Dendron engine|dendron.dev.design.engine]] which powers Dendron's lookup capabilities. The new engine is **leaner, meaner, and significantly faster** (especially when initializing your workspace with a large amount of notes).\n\nServer site indexing is a pre-cursor enables our upcoming roadmap items which include:\n\n- [[multi-vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]\n- rich graphical interfaces for schemas, pods, and publishing\n- unified index for all dendron extensions (currently each extension makes a separate index of your notes and requires manual reloading)\n- realtime updates for graph extensions\n- custom dendron extensions written in any language \n\nServer side indexing is currently off by default since it's still a beta feature. You can turn it on by adding the following in your settings.\n\n```json\n\"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport\": true\n```\n\nNote that the current commands are currently un-available when you switch on on server side indexing:\n\n- RenameNote\n- Refactor Hierarchy\n- Archive Hierarchy\n- Realtime Schema Updates\n- Pod Commands\n\nYou can switch back to regular indexing at anytime by changing the above setting to `false` and running `> Developer: Reload Window`. \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **Additional Arguments for lookup**: You can now use `noConfirm` and `value` arguments when creating custom lookup shortcuts ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup))\n- **Update Default Snippets**: default todo snippet now leaves a space after insertion\n- **Set custom log levels**: you can now define the verbosity of dendron logs using the `dendron.logLevel` configuration\n- **Upgraded Schema defaults** (server only): new schemas will be created using version one defaults\n- **Cleaner note frontmatter** (server only): new notes won't have the optional attributes in frontmatter\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **Missing logs**: issue where `Open Logs` would not show logs\n- **Tree View empty**: tree view would not populate in some cases\n- **Upgrade Snippets with comments**: Upgrading settings would fail if they had comments inside the JSON\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- **Remove Scratch Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Scratch Note shortcut\n- **Remove Journal Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Journal Note shortcut\n\n### Progress\n\n#### Server Migration\n\nThese past two weeks have been spent on server migration work. We are almost at the end and I'm aiming to have full coverage of all existing functionality by early next week.\n\n((ref:[[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]]#tasks,1:#*))\n\n### Other\n\n- Add overview of [[configuration|dendron.topic.config]]\n- Add proposal for [[custom color tabs|dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.color-tabs]]\n\n## [0.12.6](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.5...v0.12.6) (2020-10-07)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Default Snippets\n\nDendron now initializes your workspace with common default snippets\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.snippets]]#default snippets,1:#*))\n\n#### Latex Support on Published Site\n\n((ref:[[dendron.pro.dendron-jekyll.topic.math]]#math,1:#*))\n\n#### Introduce siteRepoDir Customization\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.publishing.configuration]]#siterepodir,1:#*))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- trying to publish the `dendron-template` no longer results in a missing links report\n- issue with schemas not showing up under lookup\n\n### Progress\n\nThis section tracks our progress against the milestones in our [[public roadmap|dendron.roadmap]]\n\n- [x] [[Seeds v0|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.seeds]]\n- [ ] Server migration, progress: 70/100\n  ```\n  - below is a summary of our progress. we are currently about half way done\n  - aiming to have a workable version using the Dendron server by next week\n  ```\n  ((ref:[[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]]#tasks,1:#*))\n\n### Other\n\n#### Seeds\n\n- We launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. A seed is a dendron site that tries to be be a all encompassing reference for a particular vertical. Dendron provides specific libraries and CLIs that make it easy for users to create seeds from existing open source content as well as personal notes.\n\nCurrent Seeds:\n\n```\n- open PKM catalogue\n- open AWS catalogue\n```\n\n((ref:[[dendron.community.showcase]]#open pkm catalogue,1:#*))\n((ref:[[dendron.community.showcase]]#open aws catalogue,1:#*))\n\n#### Alternatives\n\nthis announcement also comes with an ask.

This iteration was mostly spent on our server migration as well as a series of quality of life improvements across Dendron's core features. You can find the details of all this in the highlights below. \n\n## Highlights\n\n- move to the final phase of the [[server migration|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] \n  - Dendron server mode is now at feature parity with existing functionality \n  - the server migration is a complete re-write of Dendron's internal to go from a client to client (local) server model\n  - this is pre-requisite for a bunch of upcoming features like [[multi vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]], rich graphical interfaces, and realtime graph updates\n  - server mode will be the default for all workspaces going forward\n  - existing workspaces will be transparently migrated over after next week\n- order of magnitude speed improvements (server mode only)\n  - initializing large vaults\n  - updating links through `Rename` and `Refactor` operations \n- better note references\n  - note references can now be nested \n  - a reference to a header can be made by selecting any part of the header before running `Copy Note Ref`\n- better timestamps (server mode only)\n  - the `updated` timestamp on notes now updates on every save\n  - timestamp will now print a human friendly label \n- improved publishing\n  - dendron sites now support latex\n  - dendron will generate a bad link report for all links that do not resolve when publishing\n  - bad links will now resolve to a custom 404 link\n  - you can define a custom site repository that will be used by publishing commands\n- consolidated lookup\n  - creating journal notes and scratch notes are now part of the `Lookup Command` instead of being separate commands (the old keyboard shortcuts still work - they now map to lookup commands with custom arguments)\n  - lookup now accepts arguments that can be passed in via custom keyboard shortcuts\n  - you can control the creation of special notes as well as note selection behavior from lookup\n\n## Seeds\n\nAside from features, we've also launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. Seeds are **open source dendron sites** that **consolidate reference material** about a **particular vertical**. Content from the catalogues is derived from existing open source content as well as manual user input. Your 🙏 is welcomed and encouraged. \n\n((ref:[[dendron.community.showcase]]#open pkm catalogue,1:#*))\n((ref:[[dendron.community.showcase]]#open aws catalogue,1:#*))\n\n## Sustainability\n\nFinally, a bunch of you have asked if you can support Dendron financially. The answer is coming at the end of the month! Dendron will be coming out of **preview** in November, at which point we will launch our **Environmentalist Plan** 🌲. This is a monthly subscription to support the development of Dendron. **Environmentalist** will get a special badge on Discord, priority email/discord access to the development team, and stickers! More details on this soon.\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Britt](https://github.com/bs)\n  - [silent log errors](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/277)\n  - various doc updates \n- [onwijsbegeerte](https://github.com/onwijsbegeerte)\n  - [bad export pod placeholder text](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/270)\n- [agichim ](https://github.com/agichim)\n  - [checkbox in preview doesn't render correctly](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/269)\n- [Emaro](https://github.com/Emaro)\n  - [treeview empty in certain cases](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/263)\n- [robothor](https://github.com/robothor)\n  - [issue refactoring with mixed case filenames](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/250)\n\n((ref:[[dendron.release.changelog]]#0.12.11,1))\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/1b1aef8e-c9d5-42de-b850-d1b1467cf88b.html","relUrl":"notes/1b1aef8e-c9d5-42de-b850-d1b1467cf88b.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.12)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.12)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-20","content":"Dendron 0.12 is here 🌱\n\nThis week's focus was on publishing. We have a bunch of enhancements and additions to the publishing workflows. We also introduced the [[seeds library|dendron.topic.seeds]], a way of you to remix existing content with Dendron. You can see an example of this [here](http://aws.dendron.so/)\n\nThis release also brings some changes to Dendron's update cycle. \nYou might have noticed that Dendron updates rather aggressively 🚀🚀🚀\n\nOur current release cycle is a patch update every day and a minor release every week. \nMoving forward, we will be doing patch updates every few days and a minor release every two weeks. \n\nThe move to this new release cycle is a reflection that Dendron is growing rapidly and starting to mature. \n\nWe will be working on some major changes in October to stabilize the core feature set and make them easier to use. We will also be shifting our underlying architecture from a VSCode plugin to the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) which will result in a richer feature set and the ability for Dendron to be more easily integrated into additional editors.\n\nAs part of this update, we've put out the first version of the [Dendron principles](https://dendron.so//notes/7fcebd7d-6411-4c9d-8baf-65629dc018a1.html) which reflects our design philosophies and the direction we are taking Dendron. \n\nThis is a work in progress so feel free to make suggestions and comments in the discord.\n\nI've mentioned this before but we will also be releasing our formal roadmap by the end of the month. This roadmap will cover all major projects we plan on doing in 2020. \n\nWe are looking to come out of preview by the end of October and do a formal 1.0 release before the end of the year. \n\nI want to take this moment to again thank everyone for being part of our journey to build a better tool for managing knowledge 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 \n\nI believe we're are planting something special here and am excited to see us grow 🌱 \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n* * *\n\n## Cli\n\n### Support for seeds\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.seeds]]#seeds 🚧,1:#*))\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Standardize on core cli flags across all commands\n- More options when planting seeds\n\n## Hierarchies\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Rename when stub is present \n\n## Lookup\n\n### Lookup new notes with Selection\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.lookup]]#creating notes with a selection,1:#*))\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Lookup can extract highlighted text\n\n## Pods\n\n### Implement Json import pod\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.pod.builtin.json]]))\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- All filepaths can be set relative to the workspace root\n- Json pod can import filenames as links\n- Standardize interface for import/export pod commands\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Handle stub notes correctly on import \n\n## Publishing\n\n### Publish command\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.commands]]#publish,1:#*))\n\n### Copy note url command\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.commands]]#copy note url,1:#*))\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Support relative path for all file paths\n- Set custom path for publishing repo\n- Keyboard shortcuts for copy note url cmd\n- Be able to pass in custom args to commands\n- Support incremental page building\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Copy url truncates `//` \n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Denis Sikuler](https://github.com/gamtiq)\n  - update docs\n\n- [agichim](https://github.com/agichim)\n  - update docs\n\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n  - bug with copy note url\n\n- [Jack](https://github.com/JackQAQ-byte)\n  - issue with images on published sites\n\n- [Tom](https://github.com/peanutputter)\n  - [issue with image paths](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/200)\n\n- [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho)\n  - [writeup on files vs folders](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/210)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/8e59e25f-808c-42f1-a82a-e9ce4fd8edd8.html","relUrl":"notes/8e59e25f-808c-42f1-a82a-e9ce4fd8edd8.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.11)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.11)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-13","content":"![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/comic.1.png)\n\n- My wife, Ilana Lin, drew a comic for this week's release.

To mark this milestone, the pre-amble for this release will be a tad longer (and more sentimental) than usual. \n\nThis week's release focuses on publication and exports. Dendron sites now come with [one click collaboration support](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#edit-on-github), [note references](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#note-references), and [hierarchy hints](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#nav-based-hierarchy-hints).

Since launch, we've passed over a thousand downloads and closed over [100 issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) worth of features, enhancements, and bug fixes. \n\nIn that time, we've built an awesome community of Dendrites on Discord now numbering in the triple digits. I feel beyond grateful to everyone that has given Dendron a try in these early days 🌱 and become a part of our budding community. \n\nSpeaking of community, I would like to recognize two new **Dendrologist** - [Fayçal](https://github.com/d3vr) (@bsqrd#9701 ) and [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho) (@jojanaho#3766 ) 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾\n\nDendrologists are active members of the Dendron community that will be helping me shape our roadmap, answer questions, and collect feedback from all of you. If you've spent any time in our discord, you've probably already had chats with one or both of the folks I just mentioned.\n\nThat's all for last week's release. Stay tuned for some big announcements later this week :) \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Development\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Bad import causes dendron to not compile in case-sensitive file systems \n\n## Engine\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix bad sibling traversal cases \n- Issue with mixed case file names \n\n## Markdown\n\n### Support offset with note refs ([[docs|dendron.topic.refs]])\n\nA note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embedding.\n\n- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1\">  <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Note refs will not be resolved when inside an inline code span or a fenced code block \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix issue with preview checkbox not updating markdown \n- Fix issue with backslash causing in certain markdown blocks \n\n## Pods\n\n### Support note references when Publishing Notes ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing]])\n\nDendron has [[note references|dendron.topic.refs]] that let you inline either the whole note or parts of a note into another note. Publishing via Dendron will also publish note references as part of the process.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/8eb01f6c3196415c8aadc4992805a176\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/8eb01f6c3196415c8aadc4992805a176-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Add Export Pod Command ([[docs|dendron.topic.commands]])\n\nExport notes to an external data source.

[Kiran Pathakoda](https://github.com/kpathakota) has been one of the first to adopt Dendron as his primary note taking platform and will be helping out with the development of Dendron.\n\nIn practice, this means Kiran will be hanging around the discord, help triage issues, and help me put together a more comprehensive public roadmap for the project!\n\nIf you're interested in being more involved with the development of Dendron (and this doesn't have to involve coding), feel free to ping me on Discord or by email at [kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so).\n\nThere are a bunch of really exciting things that will be coming out over the next couple of weeks and we will need all the dendrologist we can get :) \n\n### New Channels\n\n- \\#dev: discuss all things related to Dendron development\n- \\#schemas: share and discuss schemas\n- \\#workflows: how do you take notes?\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues and contributed fixes to this release.\n\n- [Jochen Burkhard](https://github.com/herop)\n- [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho)\n- [Chris Na](https://github.com/buxel)\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n- [Denis Di Fazio](https://github.com/denisdifazio)\n- [nixsee](https://github.com/nixsee)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/1a79e2a1-c906-4ed4-a528-15bd34c4e649.html","relUrl":"notes/1a79e2a1-c906-4ed4-a528-15bd34c4e649.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.8)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.8)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-23","content":"Schemas and pods were the focus of this week's efforts. \n\nSchemas are now both more powerful and re-usable with a custom `pattern` attribute as well as the ability to `import` existing schemas. As a bonus, you can also visualize your schemas using the `Show Schema Graph` command!\n\nOn the Pod site, we've made the process of publishing a pod more flexible with per hierarchical configuration options, a unified config syntax and automatic reloading of your config on every publish. \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Bundled extensions\n\n### Add ShowSchema Command ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6.html#dendron-show-schema-graph))\n\nYou can now view your schemas using the same graph visualization as you do your notes!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/graphs.show-schema.gif)\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Dendron: reload graphs will reload both schema and note graphs \n- Dendron: reload graphs will reload both schema and note graphs \n- Dendron schema graph will show schemas by their title. if not set, revert to id. \n\n## Markdown\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Markdown parsing can now be up to 300% faster publishing a site \n\n## Notes\n\n### Create Daily Journal Note Command ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/5c213aa6-e4ba-49e8-85c5-1bdcb33ce202.html#daily-journal))\n\nThe daily journal helps you keep a journal for each day of the year. By default, it will create the journal under `daily.{date}` though this is configurable by setting the `dendron.dailyJournalDomain`.\n\nYou can create a daily journal using `> Dendron: Create Daily Journal Note` or `CMD+SHIFT+I` shortcut.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/notes.daily.gif)\n\n## Pods\n\n### Support different defaults on a per hierarchy basis when publishing ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#config))\n\nYou can now set different publishing defaults for each hierarchy (as well as general defaults for your entire vault.)\n\nAs an example, below is the config for [my website](https://kevinslin.com). It publishes everything under the `home` and `blog` hierarchies but will only publish notes under `books` if `published: true` is set on the frontmatter. \n\n- dendron.yml\n\n```yml\nsite:\nsiteHierarchies: [home, blog, books]\nsiteRootDir: docs\nconfig:\n    books:\n    publishByDefault: false\n```\n\n### Implement new website config syntax ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html#properties))\n\nNew config syntax unifies a bunch of different configuration options and renames others to more sensible names.\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Auto migrate old-style site config to new style site config \n- Always read config before publishing. no more reloading the workspace after updating dendron.yml! \n- Update site config on dendron starter template \n- Use rsync to copy assets when building pods \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Use regular copy command if rsync not installed \n- Links not being converted to ids when publishing \n\n## Schemas\n\n### Support schema import ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#imports-optional-str))\n\nIt's now possible to import schemas! This means you can now create composable schemas from re-usable pieces.\n\nExample:\n\n- foo.schema. yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nimports:\n- bar\nschemas:\n- id: foo\nparent: root\nchildren:\n    - bar.bar # notice that we prefix the id bar with the filename\n```\n\n- bar.schema.yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n- id: bar\nparent: root\nchildren: \n    - one\n- id: one\n```\n\nThe above would match the following files\n\n```\nfoo.bar # match\nfoo.bar.one #match\n```\n\n### Support match by pattern ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#pattern))\n\nYou can now explicitly specify a glob pattern for any level of your schema. If not set, defaults to the schema `id`.\n\nThe following is an example of a schema for `journal` hierarchy. \n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: journal\ntitle: journal\ndesc: \"\"\nparent: root\nchildren:\n    - year\n- id: year\ntitle: year\npattern: \"[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"\nchildren: \n    - month\n- id: month\ntitle: month\npattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\nchildren: \n    - day\n- id: day\ntitle: day\npattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\nnamespace: true\n```\n\nThis will match the following queries\n\n```\n# journal\n# journal.2020\n# journal.2020.09\n# journal.2020.09.12\n# journal.2020.09.12.foo.md\n```\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Set schema title to id if not set \n- Better error message on bad schema \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Autocomplete correctly on imported schema \n\n## Workspace\n\n### Fixes\n\n- A misconfigured POSIX path causes dendron to not load on windows \n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues and contributed fixes to this release.\n\n- [Devashish](https://github.com/ric03uec)\n- [Howard](https://github.com/runlevelrobot)\n- [komoda102](https://github.com/komoda102)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a1110.html","relUrl":"notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a1110.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.7)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.7)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-16","content":"This is one of our biggest releases yet!

They are all prefixed with `Dendron:` and can be accessed through the [command prompt](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#command-bar).\n\n### Add Doctor Command\n\n([d4fa71c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d4fa71cd839782587d47a3ba1b0f7e89742e7ffe)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#doctor))\n\nThis makes sure your workspace is up to date.

Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. \n\n### 🚧 Support Publishing Notes\n\n([e063732](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e063732d1ff082dd8520a479926e7ceb1b0893ab)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/73d395c9-5041-4d0d-9db7-080d9586136e.html))\n\nDendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset. Notes are published under the [dendron-jekyll theme](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). \n\n### Features\n\n#### Nested Hierarchies\n\ndendron-Jekyll supports the same nested hierarchies as your notes and allows you to navigate via the sidebar.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-hierarchy.gif\" />\n\n#### Lookup\n\nIf you'd rather not click, dendron-Jekyll also supports path-based lookup.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-lookup.gif\" />\n\n#### Permanent Ids\n\nEvery page is published using its unique ID which means that URLs will never change, even if the filenames do.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-ids.jpg\" />\n\n#### Free hosting, custom domain names and SSL Certs\n\nIf you have a free GitHub account, then you can host your Dendron notes for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-domain.jpg\" />\n\n#### Jekyll Liquid Tags and Variables\n\n- NOTE: this will only be \"compiled\" in the published site but won't be rendered in the regular markdown \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-liquid.gif\" />\n\n#### Selective Publication\n\nYou can choose to publish your whole vault or a single domain within your vault. \n\n- NOTE: It is not currently possible to publish multiple domains. If you would like this feature, you can vote for it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/64).\n\n### Setup initial workspace to be ready for publishing\n\n([e1242b4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e1242b494cc91b3284053b54dccecc4e4686ab7d))\n\nAll workspaces created from Dendron `0.5` onwards will have all the necessary configuration pre-loaded for publishing. \n\n## Schemas\n\nThink of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\n### Enable lookup for Schemas\n\n([19b4677](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/19b46770fe6a842831692563de96ff4a823df871)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#schemas))\n\nThe process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all. \n\nFind Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-lookup.gif)\n\nCreate Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-create.gif)\n\nDelete Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-delete.gif)\n\n### Schema Templates\n\n([0205d66](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0205d66fc4538361322ffeabb3e532f0d541b775)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates))\n\nSchema templates let you specify a pre-defined template that will automatically be applied to all notes that match the template. You can see a video of how this works below.\n\nThis is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n### Simpler Schema Syntax\n\n([d53ddb](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d53ddb73bfacc3f769db88cfd4f482a706dcb6dd))\n\nSchema syntax has been simplified. Before we had an extra `data` field to namespace the `namespace` field. We flattened all schema attributes to make the syntax more elegant. Note that the old styled `data` syntax is still supported but we recommend moving to the new syntax as `data` will be deprecated in a few releases.\n\n## Fixes\n\nBugfixes for this release\n\n- Fix issue with Journal Names on Windows ([d0bfe7f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d0bfe7fb0288e8610fc4b177ee85697a8ebc3efe))\n- Stub nodes should keep parents when deleted ([f32f291](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f32f291bc7a1ddd6c542483730e2db74b400dafa))\n- Issue with Urls in published site ([0ac8e75](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0ac8e75c95a9c4760e12bb301fc5b66b011ef0fb))\n\n## Enhancements\n\n- CI/CD testing ([d6ce68c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d6ce68c720d7e8c96d7f4bb6ab390c1bd52c5218))\n  - Dendron now has continuous integration tests for all pushes. ![](https://travis-ci.com/dendronhq/dendron.svg?branch=master)\n  - Tests run on mac, linux and windows which means moving forward, there should be fewer OS (aka Windows) related issues \n- Update [quickstart docs](http://localhost:4000/notes/e86ac3ab-dbe1-47a1-bcd7-9df0d0490b40.html)  to showcase new features ([aec0fe0](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/aec0fe0939239d84f5b7ebd9ebae57a09bcdae43))\n\n## Next\n\nA teaser of some items we are working on for the next release. You can see the full roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1).

And have you had a chance to play around with engine at all, or this is the first time.\n\n0:07  \nUm, I've opened it and read a little bit of the doc in it. And that's all I've done.\n\n0:13  \nOkay, cool. That's perfect. And so right now,\n\n0:17  \nwhen you turned up in the, in the, in the couple of discord threads was really the first point that I looked at it at all, and I haven't spent much time looking. And then you throw this out, like, Okay, this jumpstart.\n\n0:33  \nCool. Yeah. And that's kind of what this onboarding is for. It's, it's, you know, today's help, even if you haven't even opened it up just to give you the idea of, you know, why you might want to. And so right now, what you're looking at is identity and workspace, and the way so let's back up and tension. We manage your notes and our work states and if you use VS code, it's the equivalent of the VS code workspace. So that's a one to one match in there. And the way that you start off is you can initialize the workspace. And right now, I did me, we can just make a new one, like lead you. And so this is saying the workspace should be at this location. And so when we create a workspace, we can either create one with intention tutorial notes, and that has right or you can do an empty one. So I'm just going to do an empty one in this case. And so when you create an empty workspace, you have one file, which is the root file. And this is just there for this is kind of like your phone. And the way that denture and works is if you want to create a file, you can just type command L. I'm going to toggle screencast mode, command l triggers to look up bar, and most of the things you'll do in engine will involve this one have you used tools like Notational Velocity no So Notational Velocity, it's it was a tool where basically when you are looking for a file, for example, if I type Python, if the file doesn't exist, then it creates it for you. If it does, if that if it does exist, it will fetch it. So it's this idea that you never really have to think about\n\n2:22  \nthe accessing your data.\n\n2:26  \nAnd\n\n2:27  \nso I'm assuming that dendron is putting the is that a YAML? header?\n\n2:33  \nYes, that is a yamo header.\n\n2:35  \nSo it's just automatically doing that when it creates the file.\n\n2:39  \nExactly.\n\n2:41  \nAnd for the yamo header, the idea here is we store some metadata. So every node has a unique ID. And the reason we do that is because if you choose to you can publish your notes. That's my local version that this is the engine website is actually a published vault.\n\n2:59  \nAh, Why. So I created a\n\n3:03  \nworkspace with the with the help notes. Yeah. So that's why it looks the same.\n\n3:10  \nYep, exactly. And it is generated from the notes. And the reason and if you notice the IDs for each note, when you publish the notes are actually published by their ID not by the name. And what's nice about that is even if you've renamed the notes, as long as you keep the frontmatter, it will show publish to the same URL.\n\n3:29  \nInteresting,\n\n3:30  \nokay. And, okay, so, and as I'm battling off, if at any point, you want to just like stop me and say, like, hey, like, what's this? What would you guess? Do you just feel free to I tend to otherwise just keep talking?\n\n3:42  \nOh, no, that's fine. That's exactly what I was hoping. Okay,\n\n3:45  \nokay. Um, so creating, so as far as creating notes, you can type it. If it exists, it'll fetch it. If it doesn't then it it will create a another way of creating notes as using wiki links, which is double bracket syntax. So for example, if I wanted to go to Ruby, I could type in Ruby. And then if you do the go to definition shortcut, then you can go to default on Mac is something different. I just changed it to Ctrl, enter. So if I do Ctrl, enter, I can go into Ruby, sometimes some markdown preview, well, like, not update right away. But in, for example, in groovy, I can type in Python, and I can go here and I can go back to Python. And making these links, it's kind of the same thing as look up in like JavaScript, for example, JavaScript doesn't exist. But if I navigate to it, then venturing well creatively.\n\n4:42  \nThat's kind of the same way obsidian works.\n\n4:47  \nAnd it's just this idea that you shouldn't be thinking about the order of files. It's, you know, not likely and notetaking should just be the information that you're working with. And as far as bi directional linking On the left hand panel, so we have a backlink section. And the backlinks section shows you all the notes that this note is linked by. And so in Python, it's showing you that hey, Ruby links do Python. Yep. And I think obsidian has a similar panel, but it's, yeah, it's a backlink panel. Now, the thing that Oh, and I guess one more thing before I get into hierarchies, we support let's see, this is header one.\n\n5:35  \nThis is header Two,\n\n5:39  \none.\n\n5:43  \nSo denisha. We also support what we call defences, loan costs and block graph. I think loan costs and block references. We call them nodes references. I think obsidian also has a doe I'm not sure what they call it.\n\n5:58  \nI don't actually have this Same. There are references to headers and things, but they don't. It's a little different.\n\n6:07  \nRight? So what I'm going to show you is in dendron, you can embed notes and other notes. So for example, I just hit Command Shift R, which copy the left lens of this note, and the, and then I can paste it, for example in JavaScript. And so I'm seeing the Python notes embedded in the JavaScript note. You can either choose to reference a note, or you can choose to reference a header. So for example, everything starting from heading one, and you can also do games. So you can say everything starting from header one to header two, that you can embed notes into other nodes. And then the other thing that you can do is you if you keep bullets, the markdown preview is mutable in the sense that you can click on the lead and also update the markdown. Yes, that's a little thing that I find people get quite excited about that\n\n7:08  \nover if you're going to use to do if you're going to use those\n\n7:10  \nas to dues it's a big deal. Exactly. Um, okay, and now getting to the part. So right now what I've shown you it's pretty similar to obsidian it's pretty similar to go more like how normal note taking apps work. The things that dungeon the dungeon now starts doing differently is we're focused on having your notes conform to some sort of structure. And so that's not to say like, as you can see, like we support backlinks so you can link any note to any note. But the problem that I found and the reason why I made my own note taking tool is I find that once you get a lot of notes, you need some sort of structure, if you organize it, if it's all backlinks, like it becomes really hard to find something, whether it's a naming convention, whether it's some sort of hierarchy, like there need to be some sort of structure to help you find it. And so in Benjamin, for us that structure is hierarchy. So the way that you create a hierarchy, and Benjamin is whatever. So when you do command L, you the lookup bar gets populated by the current note that you're in. And so if you have not, then you're creating a new level in the hierarchy. So for example, I can do Python data. And so you know, this is a data node. But the hierarchy is, Python is parents data as a child. And under data, for example, I might want to do if I'm learning about Python, data could be you know, all of the various data structures that Okay, my path and setting I can look in billions and things. And the nice thing about this hierarchy is now instead of, you know, you manually having to link all the nodes together, because you are in the Python hierarchy, you can you have a bird's eye view of everything in this hierarchy.\n\n8:59  \nThat's just kind of Gaining\n\n9:02  \ninterest. Another way you can see the hierarchy is we have to show graph command. And so just like how obsidian has a graph, Python, now Python engine has a graph. But this is a graph with backlinks. It's a graph of your hierarchy. And so, you know, as you note, like there isn't a connection between Ruby and Python, even though there's a backlink, what this is showing you, you can think of it as a top down view of your table of contents of the hierarchies that you have. Right. Now, the nice thing about having this is like right now, for example, Python this in stone thing, that web engine lets you do, so let me back up for a moment. hierarchies, I find are one of the best ways of organizing notes by most people and most tools don't really support it as well. And that's because I think not because hacky some work, but because he had no tooling on our piece. Like if you had your files in a folder Actually, you could put them in a bunch of different folders, but then like finding them is more difficult. And then if you ever wanted to rename anything, that's just a nightmare. And so attention, we're building on this idea that it is actually some of the most effective ways of managing information with people. And we it's built around this idea that as hope you work with hierarchies, and one thing we let you view is we let you be factor. So for example, right now, I'm under a Python. But let's say that I shut off a entering text I want to replace. So I'm saying for Python instead of Python. Oops, let me again, instead of Python, go place Python with Lang Python. And what this is going to do is everywhere where you have python.md, it's going to add the Lang prefix for programming language. And if I hit proceed, proceed. What you'll notice is that not only did all the falaschi name but also If I go, for example, into movie, all the links to the palace, and also then. And so it's just an easier way of managing the hierarchies. And now, like, why might you want to do this? Well, because I have this just crazy thing. So because I have this programming language it, what it lets me do. And this is really what I started doing with my notes is, if I'm learning, for example, a programming language, and I'm working on like two or three at a time, it's really difficult to context switch between them. It's like, how do we do this in Ruby, how you listen to Python? What I found was much more conducive is if I could think like, okay, in a programming, what is my model for programming language. And so for example, a programming language has data structures, and so I could apply that to Ruby as well. So for example, for Ruby, it also has data structures. And then what I could do is when I'm learning about Ruby, you know, I could translate that higher He that I learned from Python, and put it into a movie. And what this lets me do now is, now it's a lot easier to context switch between different programming languages, because I'm thinking more about the concepts than the actual implementation. And for example, now, if I'm like in my hierarchy for So first of all, like, if I'm looking at data structures in Python, I have all of them in one view. But now let's say that I want to look up data structures for all my programming languages, then I also have a similar view for that. And so now, this idea, and this is where it really, for me, like, became like, the way that I did all my notes is having these hierarchies not only are they a great organizational scheme, because now instead of having 100, you know, 1000 notes at the top level, you only have, you know, the very good stuff behind this. So it's programming languages. It's cooking as you know. Few things that you care about at the top level, and you can drill down into them. And when you drill down into them, it's not just organizational. It's something that, for me, at least, it helps me learn about the topic. Because I find the heipiess that I create, for, you know, a programming language or anything, they affect my mental model of it. And I find over time, when I'm learning about things, it's not actually the implementation that matters, but it's the fact that I've been able to develop this hierarchy and then continue refining it over time.\n\n13:34  \nThat makes sense. Well, there's nothing that keeps you from just having a bunch of loose notes at some, somewhere even if, even if it's nothing. If for the sake of cleanliness, you you create a hierarchy starting with Miss and stuff under it. You have the same thing you have typically totally get the language thing. I once had a situation where I had the word two computer assembly languages. Yeah. And one of them had right to left operation on the instructions. And the other had left to right, but three quarters and now, three quarters of the names of operations were the same. So you just had to remember whether you were in left, right or right, left. So yeah, I totally get that.\n\n14:28  \nAnd the other thing that I do for these notes, and let me just going to show you this is my one of my vaults. This is a notes for a meeting today. But for example, I have a CI and this is like all the CI commands that I run into, and it's not just necessary. Oh, okay. So that one. It's like, if I run into a problem instead of, you know, googling it,\n\n14:55  \nyeah.\n\n14:56  \nI don't know how half a cache of it. So if I run into the same problem, they And, you know, I can just go into that COI hierarchy.\n\n15:04  \nAnd right because it's the one, it's the one. I did that last month. I know I know that, but I don't remember.\n\n15:12  \nExactly. And if you look at this, I think I have a couple of hundred different commands. And the nice thing about this as like, I did none of this, you know, ahead of time, it was kind of a just in time, I ran into cognitive work. I needed to Stack Overflow, it took me 10 minutes. I never want to spend time on it again. Let me go into, you know, yeah.\n\n15:36  \nOkay, cool.\n\n15:38  \nSo, can we look a little bit at, um, kind of your to dues?\n\n15:44  \nYeah. So, two dues let me actually, okay, I'm going to do two things. I'm first going to show you how you would create it from scratch and then I'll show you my two dues for the day. I like to organize things by projects. And so I usually have like a project hierarchy. Actually. And so for example, one project might be different. And so under dendron, what I actually do is I have a daily journal that I go over everything I need to do for that particular day. And let me think, what is the best way of showcasing, I'm just going to show you my to do actually.\n\n16:28  \nSo this is my to do for a dendron.\n\n16:32  \nAnd let me show you and the video. And what I do is intention, you have this notion of your journal notes. And so journal notes is basically whatever hierarchy you're currently in, and appends journal to it in the current date. And this is configurable. You can change the date format, you can change how it appends it, but I'm going to move on to tomorrow's date. And the way you do that is Ctrl Shift J. But you can use that to create a new Going on it. And then what I do is every day, are you familiar with snippets inside VS code?\n\n17:07  \nOh, I haven't used them inside VS code. I use external snippet code.\n\n17:14  \nWell, I, anyways, I use a bunch of snippets. And so apprehension journal snippet, and that will fill it out with\n\n17:21  \nOkay, might get the idea even though I haven't used it.\n\n17:25  \nYeah. And then the way I do two dues that's worked really well. For me, if I'm just working by myself, I have a snippet to make this bullet. And then I'll write you know, task one, task two tasks week.\n\n17:38  \nSomething that\n\n17:40  \ndension does fairly well is for example, sometimes like past one, it turns out to be a much bigger task and has a notion of sketch notes. And so let me and so this is all just special cases, it's you can create a sketch note by Command Shift s, and you can choose to add a title or not. If you don't add a title by default. It creates under your current high hierarchy denture and dots batch, and then the current date and timestamp. And you can think of this cache notice as caches, it's just, oh, I'm in a meeting, I need to take a note, I don't want to figure out where I'm gonna move it. So I'm just going to start you know, taking. And so that's kind of the purpose of discussion. And then later on, you can like rename it, and then follow it away somewhere if you want to. The more interesting thing is, if I highlight tasks, for example, and then I do the shortcut for a sketch note, what it does, is it creates a link from this task to the sketch note. And so now, you know, I can use this to create nested tasks. So you know, task 1.1 1.2 and if I find that, you know, task 1.1 is still too big, and I need to break it down even further. I can create another cash flow from that and then you know, create even more tasks. So you can go as deep as you want to that I usually find that to be To TCP level sign up yeah\n\n19:04  \nthat deeper probably needs to be broken up\n\n19:08  \nand but what's really cool about this is you can start off with a bullet and you can still keep this nicely bulleted list but then you can you know, expand upon it as much as you need to. Um, but as far as like project management goes the way I manage projects is I have my daily to dues and then I look at my to dues from the previous day. And then like anything I haven't done the previous day, I will copy it over into today. And then I will I use a bullet journal format so like I will add like a lesson sign.\n\n19:47  \nGo No, I don't use it, but I'm familiar with it.\n\n19:51  \nAnd something else that you can do is this is VS code feature more than attention feature better And then most people don't know about this. If you notice, for example, I have tags to some of my tasks, what I can do VS code has a search editor feature where you can search within your current note. And so if I type in start, it shows me For example, all my lines were have to start counting. And what's cool about this is this search is globbing. And so what I can do is by I have this shortcut set up, that brings me a search of whatever the current notice, but I can, for example, go here to show me Okay, what are all my past titled start within this month? And this shows me all of that materialized in a single view. All right, go What is everything, you know, in this year, or, you know, it's a quote skyjack so you can get as fancy as you like, and what what I will say this like this search, edit I view it's a VS code thing, not an engine thing, but it's Because the engine, if you follow dingemans method of putting stuff in hierarchies, it makes us search things super powerful, because now you can glob and search within. Yeah, the big dates. You can, for example, if you think back to a programming example, in Python, you can search, you know, under Python, everything in Python that has a gotcha tag, or everything in programming languages, that was hard. And that is something that you get for free with the hierarchy. This is nicely structured, being able to just search everything within that.\n\n21:38  \nSo what's really fascinating about this for me to watch, is that the name that you get, which is the hierarchy with with dots as separators on the mainframe, that's actually how hierarchical folder structures are achieved. Yeah,\n\n22:01  \nthat exact naming convention.\n\n22:04  \nNice. I haven't had the pleasure of using many mainframes in the days.\n\n22:09  \nYeah, so that was that one harks back, like decades for me. Okay.\n\n22:14  \nUm, so I have an unrelated question, what is the tool you're using? That's echoing the keystrokes. And that's actually VS code. So VS code has something called screencast mode. I'll go ahead, it will show you all the keystrokes.\n\n22:29  \nCool. All right.\n\n22:31  \nAnd that's a nice thing about building engine inside VS code is that, for me, like what was different about attention and what the thing I'm trying to promote is this idea of keeping your notes in a hierarchy and giving you the tools to work with that hierarchy. But then all the other stuff, for example, like being able to work with markdown and supporting multiple panes and having all the other stuff that you need in an editor. It's not really differentiating and you codecademy is a great place for that. And plus you have all the extensions. And VS code has and VS code has like a lot of new features. One of them another one that I really like that I find most people don't know about is you can toggle lines. So if you do option, arrow key, you can move lines up and down. And I find that really nice for prioritizing because I usually like to, you know, keep stuff in this sort of format. And this way, I can easily move stuff down when I'm done. And what's cool is it's not just a single line, you can highlight a whole block and you can move that whole block at a time. But it's just another one little known feature that I find it makes a big quality of life. Yeah.\n\n23:48  \nLet's see.\n\n23:51  \nUm, this. That's the other thing that you can do. indention is you can paste images. I find that's a question I get a lot specially with Mark And so I use a program called sketch, which lets me take a screenshot of the screen. And then if I do Command Shift C, it puts that image into my clipboard. And then inside address, you can kinda paste image command, which will take whatever is in your clipboard, put it in this path in the vault. And then now you have the picture. And I find that useful because I in markdown paste ads at night, adding media is usually like a problem that people have.\n\n24:32  \nYeah, obsidian handles that pretty well, much the same way. So yeah, that one I haven't had a lot of friction on.\n\n24:41  \nAnd\n\n24:42  \nthat's really interesting.\n\n24:45  \nYeah, the hierarchy is definitely the thing that I am working upon. And oh, one thing I haven't shown you and this is more of an advanced feature, but you can create schemas for your hierarchies and you can think of femurs is kind of being able to type check. And so I'll show you what I mean by that. So right now I'm creating a lens. And the way I go to schema is I do Command Shift L. And this shows me all the schemas that I have. So it's kind of lookup, but instead of looking for markdown files, I'll explore YAML files. And so your schema, it is just a yamo. And it follows. And what it does, so is it says that, okay, there is a node that is named. And so Lang is the root of your hierarchy. And you can, for example, say that this has children. So for example, Python, it's Ruby. And the only thing you need to specify for the children is that they exist. And now you need to reload the index between schema changes because it hasn't picked up on Live, that's going to change later. But now, if I go into my lookup, if I type in Lang, for example, you'll notice it's actually a little book to it. And the little book over here means that hey, Lang is part of the schema. And if I go down, I can see that Oh, like there's a little book next to Python. That's part of the schema. If you look at JavaScript, because I created\n\n26:31  \nit. It's not in the schema, if you look at Java, this little question mark, because it's not in the schema. And the reason you might want to do this is for example, like as I'm building my hierarchy, oh, one thing is you don't have to like enumerate everything. So this a namespace property where you can say this is a namespace. And so now, this is essentially saying that this is going to match now Not start the globbing pattern. The scheme is just based off this simple globbing pattern\n\n27:06  \nthat would pick up if it existed.\n\n27:08  \nYeah. And so now if I go to Java, this little book to it, because that's in a sec, okay, I recognize it. Now, the interesting part here is now for my children, for example, if I say data,\n\n27:21  \nso data structures,\n\n27:24  \nand you know, and data, let's say that as their children, like, spring, I have a lot of different autocompletes. So that Well, sometimes,\n\n27:38  \nyeah, no, I know how that works. I get that a lot. Yeah.\n\n27:43  \nSo let's say that I crave\n\n27:46  \nthat. And so this schema of the way that the globbing patterns work is the children will inherit the parents as a prefix. So this will match Lang dot star dot data. And then string will match Lang dot star dot data watchman. But the schema is also hierarchal. And so now, if I reload my index, if I go to lang.db, dot away, for example, there's a book, because it's part of my schema. But if I look into your data, that Boolean does nothing, because it's not part of my schema. And schemas are really lightweight. It's just that yamo and we don't stop you from creating things outside of your schema, we just show you a question mark. But it's nice. For example, if you're building a programming language hierarchy, and just like sometimes use Google, sometimes use Boolean and you want to keep it consistent, you can document it in your schema. And the engine will also tell you when you're going outside of it, and in the future, we'll add options if you want you to actually enforce it. So you can say like, hey, like, actually don't have any great things that go outside of this. Okay? And that's just because like if my this is how likely entropy builds up and up looks like you name one thing for one fee and then another one for another, and then you have a million different things.\n\n29:07  \nYep, I have, I have several backlinks that I have to go clean up because I did somebody's name or title or something differently in two different places.\n\n29:20  \nl and schema strike now. We are also this going to be more features that you can do with schemas. And right now, it does two things. One is it gives you the little book with a little question mark, if you're in a note that matches it. The other thing is you can assign templates to it. So for example, for this thing, I can say that it has a template. And what that means is when I create a note that matches the schema, automatically apply this template to it. And so the idea of this template is going to be the name of another note. And so for example, if I just do a Lang, template, M and M Then I can say this is something inflige. And it's a note template. And the reason you have this this in the future will have different types of templates, you can make templates from snippets, or other sources. And now if I reload my index, and let's create a screen for something I don't have fishing for so let's say Lang dot java data archwing. And oh, something else that schemas that you do is it autocompletes so like, even though again, string haven't been created, it shows you Hey, this matches the dang schema. According to that schema, you happen assumptions.\n\n30:40  \nNice. So if I type in train,\n\n30:46  \nit shows you how demos will always break your hearts.\n\n30:52  \nOf course,\n\n30:54  \nthat's me.\n\n30:57  \ndelete this. So Command Shift D is to do Return note.\n\n31:03  \nAnd\n\n31:06  \nlet's try this again. I might have to reload the window for it to pick it up. So, let me I just reloaded the window. I'm going to delete this and then try to create it one more time. And then hopefully, but\n\n31:26  \nOkay, I'll look into that. But so yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.\n\n31:37  \nAnd there are other things, but these are essentially like the core parts of dendron. Something else that you can do is you can take your notes, and you can publish it to GitHub. So that's a build command. Right now, because we're in an empty space, you need to run another command to add in some pals, but basically what that when you do build power On a workspace is that it can, it'll generate, it'll turn it into static files that you can publish to GitHub. And it'll have the same template as an engine website. Um, and it's also hierarchical. So you know you the same hierarchy you happen engine you can have on your website, you can choose to publish either everything in your vault, or you can choose which hierarchies you want to publish. And then the other thing is this search bar here. This is actually also path based. So the same lookup mechanism that you use insight engine, you can also use on an engine website.\n\n32:42  \nNice. Yeah.\n\n32:43  \nCool.\n\n32:44  \nYep. Well, thank you. Yeah, no problem.\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/097cf7ed-e9aa-4580-86cf-0347bf7a623d.html","relUrl":"notes/097cf7ed-e9aa-4580-86cf-0347bf7a623d.html"},{"doc":"Titles","title":"Titles","hpath":"dendron.ref.titles","content":"We recommend using all lower kebab case when naming your files.

Writing Tests\n\nWhen writing a test for new functionality, make sure to consider both the `single` vault and `multi-vault` scenario. \n\nTo write a test, use the `runLegacySingleWorkspaceTest` or `runLegacyMultiWorkspaceTest` methods to setup a mock Dendron workspace of the respective type.\n\nYou can see an example of both in [plugin-core/src/test/suite-integ/RenameNoteV2.test.ts](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/suite-integ/RenameNoteV2.test.ts#L131:L131)\n\nThe arguments are explained [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/testUtilsV3.ts#L70:L70).\n\n### Test Runner\n\nNote that VSCode uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as its default test runner whereas Dendron uses  [jest](https://jestjs.io/).\n\nWe shim the [jest methods](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/testUtilsv2.ts#L418:L418) when testing the plugin though so that we can re-use the same logic between our

NOTE: we are still using remark12 so make sure to install the remark12 compatible version of the plugin\n    - instructions to add new packages [[here|dendron.dev.cook#install-a-new-package]]\n1. update `src/markdown/utils.ts` in engine-server\n    - import plugin and add it to the appropriate processor (most likely `procFull`)\n1. write a test for the plugin. plugin tests are located in `engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/markdown/`\n    - example [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/markdown/container.spec.ts)\n    - `createProcTests` is a special function that sets up a Dendron workspace and can help you run a unified processor for multiple output formats\n    - your test should cover every output format that your plugin affects\n    - best way to understand is by example, see the other tests in the same folder for additional examples of how to use this function\n1. write the plugin implementation\n1. make sure your tests pass\n    - its helpful to use the `matchSnapshot` functionality that jest provides\n    if you use the `checkVFile` helper function, this happens automatically\n    - you can view snapshots in `__snapshots__/` folder which is relative to the test\n1. add a flag in `DendronConfig` to toggle the plugin\n    -

Setup Monorepo\n- see instructions [[here|dendron.dev.setup]]\n\n### 2. Create links to the monorepo packages\n\nRun `yarn link` inside the following packages\n* @dendronhq/engine-server\n* @dendronhq/common-server\n* @dendronhq/common-all\n\n\n### 3. Link monorepo to 11ty\n\nInside dendron-11ty, execute `./scripts/link.sh` file\n\n- NOTE: don't forget to watch the monorepo to compile changes\n\n![[dendron.dev.setup#watch-monorepo,1:#*]]\n\n### 4.

At that point, you should be able to narrow down the root cause to one of the issues below. If not, please bring it up on the [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) or file a [bug report](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)\n\n## General\n\n### Engine not initialized\n\nThis is most likely due to the VSCode [workspace file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files) not being open. Make sure to open the **dendron.code-workspace** file by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files)\n\n### Multiple Vaults with the same name\n\nYou will get this if you have multiple [[vaults|dendron.topic.config#vaults]] that have the same name. This is an error with Dendron since Dendron requires all vault names be unique. You can fix this by removing the duplicate vaults or setting a unique [[name|dendron.topic.config#name]] property for the vault.  \n\n### Notes from the graph/tree view are out of sync\n\nRun `Dendron: Reload Index` to manually sync. If that doesn't work, you can also try `Developer: Reload Window` to restart VSCode.\n\n## Upgrading\n\n### Error upgrading\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble.upgrade.png)\n\nDendron will update keybindings/settings/etc to the latest defaults if not currently set on upgrade. If you see the above error, it means that Dendron had trouble parsing one of your settings files. This doesn't stop dendron from starting but it does mean that the latest settings aren't being applied.\n\nThe most likely culprit of this error is a bad snippets file. To fix, bring up the command prompt, type `>Configure User Snippets`, open `dendron.code-snippets` and see if there's anything funky with the json on the line mentioned by the error. You can also use tools like [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.\n\n## Schemas\n\n### I'm getting a `you cannot define a mapping item when in a sequence` when trying to define a schema\n\nThat means there's an issue with your yaml. You can paste it in [yaml lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check that you are using the correct yaml syntax. \n\n### Schema Templates aren't working\n\nSchema templates are defined as YAML objects. The most common mistake is putting them down as a list\n\nFor example, this is a valid schema.\n\n```yml\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - daily\n- id : daily\n  namespace: true\n  template:\n    id: journal.template.daily\n    type: note\n```\n\nThis is not a valid schema.\n\n```yml\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - daily\n- id : daily\n  namespace: true\n  template:\n    - id: journal.template.daily\n      type: note\n```\n\n## Markdown Preview\n\n### Why can't I click the checkbox?\n\nIt could be that you are using the VSCode default markdown instead of Dendron's Markdown Preview. \n\nThey both have identical icons and its currently not possible to disable the builtin preview (we are looking into fixing this [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/42)).\n\nMeanwhile, you can open Dendron's markdown preview by clicking the preview button on the left of the menu bar or by using the `> Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side` command\n\n![Markdown preview](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble-md.png)\n\n### Still initializing.  Please close this window and try again after Dendron has been initialized.\n\nWhen Dendron starts up, it initializes a local server which is responsible for indexing notes and fetching note metadata. Plugins like the preview depend on the server being initialized before activating. You'll know the server is initialized after you see a `Dendron is activated` notification.\n\n## Linux\n\n### Reference to Another Note on Ubuntu\n\nIf Ctrl+Shift+R (reference to another note) doesn't work on Ubuntu, do `sudo apt install xsel`.\n\n## Publishing\n\n### Can't open local preview\n\nDendron runs the preview on port 8080. Make sure you don't have something already running there.\n\n- windows\n```powershell\n# get ids of processes\nGet-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080).OwningProcess\n\n# if you see any result, you can stop them using the following command\nStop-process -Id {IDS_FROM_ABOVE}\n```\n\n- linux\n```bash\n# get ids\nlsof -l -n -P -i tcp:8080 \n\n# kill\nkill -9 {IDS}\n```\n\n## Etc\n\n### Error: spawn git ENOENT\n\nCheck if you have git installed. You can find more details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42545885/vs-code-error-spawn-git-enoent)\n\n### Clicking on the link creates multiple files\n\nThis is likely due to other extensions that you have installed that provide conflicting definitions for [[wiki links|dendron.topic.links#wiki-links]].\n\nThe most likely culprits are `foam` or `markdown-notes`. Uninstalling them will fix this issue. \n\nYou can see your installed \n\n## Send a support request\n\nIf none of the troubleshooting methods work, you can ping kevin on Discord or submit a github issue.\n\nWhen doing either of these things, please include the following information:\n\n- [[Plugin Logs|dendron.guides.cook#checking-logs]]\n- [[Server Logs|dendron.guides.cook#server-logs]]\n- Contents of your [[workspace settings|dendron.guides.settings]]\n- Contents of [[dendron.yml|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]]\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html","relUrl":"notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html"},{"doc":"Tips","title":"Tips","hpath":"dendron.guides.tips","content":"\n## Bucket\n\n### Peeking\n\nIt is possible to [peek](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_peek) at wiki-links in Dendron.

I use it to start a search with the current filename. works really well with Dendron hierarchies.\n\n```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+s f\",\n    \"command\": \"search.action.openNewEditor\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"query\": \"\",\n      \"triggerSearch\": false,\n      \"focusResults\": false,\n      \"includes\": \"${fileBasenameNoExtension}\",\n    }the following line\n  }\n```\n\n### Stylized Tags Using Custom CSS\n\nTo customize the look and feel of your tags, you can do so by using the following convention and [CSS edits](https://www.dendron.so/notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html#can-i-customize-the-markdown-preview-css).\n\nLet's say you have a `books` hierarchy and you have a `books.high-growth-handbook` note. You have all the tags you use for books under a `books.tags.` namespace.\n\nIf you use links for tags: `[[#business|books.tags.business]]`, you can use this CSS to customize their look:\n\n```css\n/* General tag styling */\na[href*=\".tags.\"] {\n    color: #000;\n    background: #fff;\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding: 0 10px;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n}\n/* Customizing the look of specific tags */\na[href*=\".tags.business\"] {\n    color: #fff;\n    background: rgb(36, 89, 233);\n}\n```\n\nThe result looks like this:\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tags.png)\n\n### Collapsing Headers and Bullets\n\nYou can collapse headers at different levels and bullets at different indentation levels inside VSCode. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.toggle-bullets.gif)\n\n\n### Create a new note in a deeply nested hierarchy \n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/758235198403117087)\n\n- Problem: \n   - You are currently in `foo` and you want to create the note `foo.child1.child2.my-note`. You don't want to type out the full path. Is there an easier way to create `my-note` than typing out the full path?\n- Solution: \n  - VSCode doesn't support autocomplete inside the quick input widget which Dendron uses for lookups. We are experimenting with different ways of getting around this. \n  - Today, the workaround is to create a wiki-link inside another note and navigate via link to create it. \n  - Another method, if you know you will be creating multiple children under a single deeply nested parent, is to pin the parent and create the child from the parent \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/f0bbfc9cae0a474a99f8a1169b7b96c7\">\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/f0bbfc9cae0a474a99f8a1169b7b96c7-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n\n### Automate Git Tasks\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/742532267058004098/759130627781558403)\n- Problem:\n  - You want an easier way to `git add && git commit && git push`\n- Solution\n  - Use [git automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit).\n\n### Publish to GitHub Pages with Actions\n\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/749641193322971238/759190468671438848)\n\nIt's possible to publish your Dendron site to GitHub Pages without the shadow copy of your notes in the `docs` directory.\n\nYou can create a GitHub Actions workflow to perform the export process using the Dendron CLI and push the result to your `pages` branch, triggering a Pages build.\n\nNote that this configuration won't retain any history on the `paths` branch. Paths below are relative to your workspace root.\n\nIgnore the shadow directories in `.gitignore`:\n\n```\ngitignore\n# Dendron\n/docs/assets/\n/docs/notes/\n/docs/_site/\n\n# npm\n/node_modules/\n```\n\nCreate a `package.json` to install the package:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dendron-cli\": \"dendron-cli\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/LukeCarrier/brain.git\"\n  },\n  \"license\": \"UNLICENSED\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@dendronhq/dendron-cli\": \"^0.12.3-alpha.16\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate the workflow `.github/workflows/dendron.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nname: Dendron\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - master\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout source\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Install npm dependencies\n      run: npm install\n\n    - name: Build pod\n      run: npm run dendron-cli -- buildSite --wsRoot ./ --vault notes/\n\n    - name: Deploy site\n      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n      with:\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        publish_branch: pages\n        publish_dir: docs/\n        force_orphan: true\n        enable_jekyll: true\n```\n\nConfigure your repository's Pages settings as follows:\n\n* _Branch_: `pages`\n* _Folder_: _/ (root)_\n\nFinally, commit these three files and push them to your `master` branch. Within a few seconds you should see the workflow run, your `pages` branch get updated and your Pages build start.\n\n### Go back to previous Note\n\nUse \"> Quick Open Previous Recently Used...` to navigate through recently opened notes\n  - default shortcut: `CTRL-TAB`\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.most-recent.gif)\n\n\n### Keep Track of Tabs\n\nIt's really easy to lose sight of your tabs, especially with menu items occluding the little horizontal space you have for tabs. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.nav.jpg)\n\nInstead of relying on the menu, you can use `Show All Editors` to see all tabs via a dropdown. You can also narrow down tabs after selection.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.editors.gif)\n\nYou can streamline this process by assigning a keyboard shortcut to the command. Below is an example.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+t\",\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.showAllEditors\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n\n### Copy and Paste Web Content into Dendron\n\nFirst copy it into Notion or use the notion web clipper to clip it. This will format it nicely in markdown. You can then paste it into Dendron with markdown and everything :)\n\n<!-- \n\n### Custom Outlines\n\nTODO: need to add more details\n\nOutlines are super helpful but there are not always feasible depending on the file format\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-21-19-33-21.png)\n\nIn those situations, I like to leave markers inside a note and use the search editor to surface those markers \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134\"> \n<p>Tips - Breadcrumbs - Watch Video</p> \n<img style=\"max-width:300px;\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134\n\nYou can use the same technique \n\n# Generating all journal notes ahead of time\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25701265/how-to-generate-a-list-of-all-dates-in-a-range-using-the-tools-available-in-bash\n-->\n\n## Workbench\n\n### Navigating a hierarchy\n\nOne easy way of navigating hierarchies it to click on the file name. This will reveal a dropdown that shows you all siblings of the current note. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/guide.siblings.jpg)\n\n### Remove Markdown Buttons in Menu Bar\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126/758408534848831558)\n\n```json\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.bold\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.italic\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.strikethrough\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.bullets\": false,\n```\n\n### Moving Panes\n\nYou can move vscode tabs using the following builtin commands:\n- `View: Move Editor Into Next Group`\n- `View: Move Editor Into Previous Group`\n\nThey are mapped on to the following keyboard shortcuts:\n- mac: `cmd+ctrl+left|right`\n\nThis is helpful for looking at your notes side by side. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/d99ec9cce8ff4d869cf8c36955152808\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/d99ec9cce8ff4d869cf8c36955152808-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Pinning Tabs\n\nYou can pin tabs in VSCode by right clicking on a tab and selecting `Pin Tab`. \n\nThe latest VSCode lets you control pin behavior for tabs. It's not currently documented as of 2020.09.28 but as of the latest insider build, it has a few different options to control the pinned behavior. \n\n- options:\n  - normal (default), normal tab size with a pin icon\n  - shrink: reduced tab size with some text visible\n  - compact: only icon visible\n\n```json\n\"workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing\": \"shrink\"\n```\n\n\n### Zen Mode\n\nVSCode can be visually noisy. You can hide most of the UI by toggling `Zen Mode` with a three panel layout. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.zen.jpg)\n\nThe following setting overrides are useful: \n\n```json\n// by default, zen mode will open a new \"workspace\" which I don't like\n\"zenMode.fullScreen\": false,\n// I'm a vim user so I like my line numbers\n\"zenMode.hideLineNumbers\": false,\n```\n\nTo navigate tabs and look at the breadcrumb outline, You can use the following commands\n\n```json\nworkbench.action.showAllEditors -> (no shortcut by default, consider mapping to ctrl + t)\nbreadcrumbs.focusAndSelect -> cmd + t\n```\n\nYou can see a video of this workflow in the video below.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/dd27df6d556d4ba6b28b2028ca7d1455\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/dd27df6d556d4ba6b28b2028ca7d1455-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Always show preview of md being edited\n\nSet the following option in your workspace settings\n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n\n## Snippets\n\n### Have links auto-complete without additional key presses\n\n- Update your settings to the following\n```json\n// The following settings will only apply to markdown files:\n  \"[markdown]\": {\n    // quickSuggestions true will provide suggestions as you type.\n    // If you turn this on and DO NOT want suggestions\n    // for non-wiki-link, non-tag words,\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": true,\n    // This is poorly documented, but seems to offer suggestions\n    // from any word in open document when turned on, which\n    // can be a little distracting in markdown docs:\n    \"editor.wordBasedSuggestions\": false,\n    \"editor.tabSize\": 2,\n    // Set this to false if you turn on quickSuggestions\n    // but don't want suggestions for markdown related snippets\n    // as you type:\n    \"editor.suggest.showSnippets\": false,\n  },\n```\n\n## Markdown\n\n### Always have the preview open\n\n\nYou can add the following setting to your workspace to always have a markdown editor show up with your content. \n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n### Symbol search\n\nWhen using the standard file-search in vscode (`ctrl-P`), you can search for all titles in your workspace if you use the starting keyword `#`\n\nExample: if i know i had a header with the title \"cheatsheet\", i can type in `# cheatsheet`\n\n### Auto bullet list\n\nVSCode doesn't support auto-formatting by default. You can use the following workaround to mimic the behavior.\n\n\n- Add list-item below current position. Using `-`\n```json\n{\n        \"key\": \"shift+enter\",\n        \"command\": \"type\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"text\": \"\\r\\n- \"\n        },\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorReadOnly && editorLangId == 'markdown'\"\n}\n```\n\n- Add list-item below current position. Using `*`\n\n```json\n{\n        \"key\": \"shift+enter\",\n        \"command\": \"type\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"text\": \"\\r\\n* \"\n        },\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorReadOnly && editorLangId == 'markdown'\"\n}\n```\n\n> Credit for this recipe goes to @Stigs#0135 \n\n\n## Other Tools\n\nThis is a list of other tools that work well with Dendron.\n- [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/): local markdown editor that works well with Dendron notes (mac only)\n\n## Other VSCode Extensions\n\n### Git\n- [Git Automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit): one command to commit and push all changes\n- [Git Doc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc): auto-commit and (optionally) auto push your notes at fixed intervals\n- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): Repository/File/Line history and annotations of all your files\n- [Path AutoComplete](https://github.com/ionutvmi/path-autocomplete): Path autocomplete for VSCode\n\n### Other\n- [Macros](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geddski.macros): Define custom macros \n- [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim): VIM key bindings 😍\n- [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks): Bookmark lines within File [Vertical Limit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=generik.vertical-limit): Work with multiple cursors and blocks of text\n- [CodeUI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanraposo.codeui): Easier customization of every part of the VSCode UI\n\n## Other Browser Extensions\n\n### Web Clipper\n- [Markdown Web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB): markdown based web clipper\n- [Roam Highlighter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mcoimieglmhdjdoplhpcmifgplkbfibp)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/692fa114-f798-467f-a0b9-3cccc327aa6f.html","relUrl":"notes/692fa114-f798-467f-a0b9-3cccc327aa6f.html"},{"doc":"Settings","title":"Settings","hpath":"dendron.guides.settings","content":"You can update Dendron settings by using the VSCode workspace settings by using the command prompt to `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings`\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/2d8eaeb6fddf4c76a390d3894b497435\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/2d8eaeb6fddf4c76a390d3894b497435-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nIf you are comfortable with editing raw JSON, you can use `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` to work with the settings in raw JSON\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/26d66e84-6e4f-4688-bf6e-af070def7c38.html","relUrl":"notes/26d66e84-6e4f-4688-bf6e-af070def7c38.html"},{"doc":"Migration","title":"Migration","hpath":"dendron.guides.migration","content":"This note covers migrating your notes from other tools\n\n## Obsidian\n\n1.

You can view the logs using the [[Open Logs Command|dendron.topic.commands#dendrondev-open-logs]]\n\n#### Server Logs\n\nDendron has two sets of logs - client and server. The client logs you can access using the `Open Logs Command`. You can access the server logs by following the tutorial [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3d04cb1d6f904ac099d73e083e62ee2f). \n\n#### Logs from previous session\n\nDendron has logs for the current session and the previous session.\n\nYou can get logs of the previous session by following instructions [here](https://www.loom.com/share/2ca740e8e09b4aaf927d8098e2e6dec0)\n\n## Bucket\n\n### Star/Favorite/Pin Notes\n\nDendron doesn't currently provide native support for this. You can download the [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks) extension to achieve the functionality in the interim.\n\n### Launch the command bar\n\nThis lets you execute commands inside vscode\n\n- Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n- macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n- Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n\n### Analyze notes using elasticsearch\n\n- WARNING: this is advanced material \n\nWith Dendron, you can export your notes using the [[JSON Export Pod|dendron.topic.pod]] and then use that data to analyze your notes using elasticsearch.\n\nThis video walkthrough walks you through that process.\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/c85c7c81d8aa4e97b4bbdf2245ca8f9b\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/c85c7c81d8aa4e97b4bbdf2245ca8f9b-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nYou can download the repo used in this walkthrough from [github](https://github.com/dendronhq/sample-elasticsearch-demo)\n\nPre-requisites:\n\n- download and run elasticsearch \n\nSteps:\n\n1. Export your data using the JSON Export Pod\n2. Create an index in elasticsearch (we're using version 7.9)\n\n```json\nPUT notes\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"created\": {\n        \"type\":   \"date\",\n        \"format\": \"epoch_millis\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Pipe exported JSON into the newly created index.\n\n```bash\ncat /path/to/exported/notes.json | jq -c '.[] | {\"index\": {\"_index\": \"notes\", \"notes\", \"_id\": .id}}, .' | curl -H'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary @-\n```\n\n4. Profit!\n\nSome potential use cases you can do using elasticsearch and Dendron:\n\n- filter your notes by any logical combination of custom attributes\n- make a heatmap of notes created by date\n- get a full list of tags used across your vault and on a per hierarchy basis\n- anything else you can thin of :) \n\nSome useful additional links: \n\n- [elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html)\n- [elasticsearch vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ria.elastic)\n\n### Convert timestamps in the frontmatter\n\nCurrently, Dendron notes show timestamps in epoch time which is not the most parsable for humans. You can use the [timestamp converter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stalinbalraj.timestamp-converter) order to see a human representation of said timestamp.\n\n### Use Dendron with Anki\n\n- [Anki for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasew.anki)\n\n### Use Dendron on a separate instance of VS Code\n\nYou can use Dendron on a separate instance of VS Code by launching it with the [command line flags](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_advanced-cli-options) `--user-data-dir` and `--extensions-dir`:\n\n```\ncode --user-data-dir=/path/to/code-dendron --extensions-dir=/path/to/code-dendron-ext\n```\n\n### Mobile Support\n\nDendron does not have a dedicated mobile client at this time. There are numerous mobile markdown editors that can be used to view and edit Dendron notes.

This is because there are few things as effective as a multi-level hiearchy for quickly filtering an overwhelming amount of information to something humans can work with. You can read [this blog post](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e1455752-b052-4212-ac6e-cc054659f2bb.html) for the extended rationale behind this.\n\nIn Dendron, you can quickly **lookup** related notes by their hierarchy. Hierarchies are simply `.` delimited filenames, similar to the hierarchies made by domain names (eg. `github.com`).\n\nThe following are a few notes that have this hierarchical naming format.\n\n```\n- cli.tar.md\n- cli.tar.env.md\n- cli.curl.md\n- cli.dig.md\n```\n\n## Lookup\n\n**Lookup** is the process of finding a note by traversing its hierarchy.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-cli.gif)\n\n> Lookups are **quick**\n\nWhat's nice about using the `.` delimited format is that a note **can be** both **a file** (something that contains data) and **a folder** (something that contains other files) **at the same time**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-folder_and_file.gif)\n\n> You **can** be a file and have your folder **too**\n\nDendron uses fuzzy matching on paths so you don't have to type out the whole path.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-fuzzy.gif)\n\n> Lazyness is the key to success\n\nYou can use **lookup** to figure out what is true!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-bool.gif)\n\n## Schemas\n\nIf you're paying close attention, you might have noticed some icons popup during lookup.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-closeup.jpg)\n\nThese icons indicate the **schema** associated with the note. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace.\n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nSchemas help you organize your notes by letting you know what comes next.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-suggest.gif)\n\nThe `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note does not exist but is part of the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n\n**Schema suggestions** don't show you an endless lineup of tags or folders - they only show you suggestions scoped to your specific level of the hierarchy that you are looking at.\n\nThe nice thing about these suggestions is that you can also ignore them.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-ignore.gif)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\nDendron will show you a `?` next to the result in future results but otherwise will assume that you know best.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n## VS Code\n\nDendron is built on top of VSCode, the open-source IDE from Microsoft.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/code-banner.jpg)\n\nDendron runs as a plugin inside VSCode. If you use VSCode today, it means that all your current knowledge, settings and extensions will carry over into Dendron. If you don't, no sweat, because Dendron will create an optimal workspace with recommended settings and extensions when you first launch it.\n\n## Recommended Extensions\n\nSince Dendron runs on top of VSCode, it means that you also have access to thousands of extensions to customize Dendron exactly how you like it.\n\nBy default, Dendron will initialize your first workspace with the following extensions and features.\n\n- [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [wiki links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n  - [backlinks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) (think Roam)\n- [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts)\n  - Quickly toggle bullet points\n  - Easily generate URLs\n  - Convert tabular data to tables\n- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n  - [live markdown preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n  - [math](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/math) (KaTeX or MathJax)\n  - [sequence diagrams](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/diagrams?id=mermaid) (mermaid)\n  - [pandoc support](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/pandoc)\n  - [code chunks](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/code-chunk)\n  - [presentations](https://rawgit.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/master/docs/presentation-intro.html)\n- [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)\n  - beautiful colors built using the [Material design system](https://material.io/)\n- [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)\n  - easily add images from your clipboard to your markdown files\n- [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)\n  - Spell Check\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe following extensions also work well with Dendron but are not bundled by default.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n   ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/2880px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png)\n   - Image by Quasar Jarosz at English Wikipedia\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you organize, manage, publish, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\n\n### How is Dendron different from X note taking tool?\n\nSubstitute X with `roam|obsidian|foam|one note|evernote|...`\n\nAll note taking tools (try to make it) easy to get notes in. Its getting it back out again that's hard and it **becomes harder** as you get more notes.\n\nWhether you are using notebooks tags, or backlinks, once you have more than a few hundred notes, you'll need to have some sort of structure in place (eg. naming convention, hierarchy, etc) to keep track of it. \n\nDendron is a highly opinionated note taking tool that focuses on **hierarchal note taking**. It provides the freedom of Roam's _every note exists everywhere philosophy_ while layering on top **flexible hierarchies** to keep track of it all. \n\nWhile Dendron works with knowledge bases of any size, it really shines once you've accumulated a few hundred notes. I created it to handle my personal knowledge base of 20k+ markdown notes - Dendron lets me track and find any specific note in it in seconds. You can read more about Dendron's hierarchal approach to note taking [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html).\n\n### How is Dendron different from Roam?\n\nWhereas Roam is built around the idea of **bi-directional links** (and daily journals) which help you create notes without having to explicitly organize your notes, Dendron is built to help you organize notes without friction using **flexible hierarchies**.\n\nWe provide the tooling to create, enforce, and change these hierarchies at will. If you think of Roam as a graph database for notes, you can think of Dendron as Redis. To give you a sense of scale, I use Dendron to manage a corpus of +20K notes. \n\nSome additional features that set Dendron apart:\n- Dendron allows you to compose your workspace with vaults (a vault is a collection of notes that can come from anywhere) from any number of sources\n- Dendron is based on plain text (Dendron flavored) markdown (exportable to regular markdown or any other format)\n- Dendron is integrated into VSCode  \n- Dendron allows for easy publishing public/private content to any platform that can host a static site (and we're rolling out our own publishing platform to help people publish with additional access controls)\n\n### How does Dendron help me track my notes?\n\n1. Dendron organizes and collapse all your  notes into managable chunks using [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]].\n2. Dendron helps you manage your hiearchies using [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]]\n3. Dendron gets out of your way when your working with your notes during [[lookup|dendron.topic.lookup]]\n\nDendron's secret sauce is that it provides the necessary tooling for you to work with hierarichal notes. While hierarchies have traditionally (and justifiably) gotten a bad, I would argue that this is because the **tooling** around hierarchies were bad, not because hierarchies themselves are bad. \n\nHierarchies are one of the most effective ways that **both humans and computers** process large amount of information (there's a reason why almost every database is built from a variation of the [b-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)). You can find further details about hierarchies in this [blog post](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e1455752-b052-4212-ac6e-cc054659f2bb.html)\n\n### Is Dendron Free? Will it stay free?\n\nDendron, the client, is free and will always remain free. It is also open source so anyone is free to make their own fork of Dendron.\n\nThat being said, I'm all in on Dendron and this is my full time gig. I want to make sure that developing Dendron remains sustainable. To that end, I plan on introducing value add server side functionality that folks may pay for. Examples of paid for features include: \n\n- private hosting (for folks who want to publish but not use github pages or want to add authentication)\n- enterprisy things \n  - eg. on premise installations of Dendron with single sign on, active directory, and fine grained permissions\n- offering private subscription based vaults (eg. think [substack](https://substack.com) but having people subscribe to vaults instead of newsletters )\n- server side IFTTT like functionality (eg. everytime I add an entry to airtable, add a note to Dendron)\n\nPaid for features will be 100% optional and will not be necessary for any client side functionality in Dendron.\n\n### Why is Dendron built on top of VSCode?\n\nAs with all things, its a matter of tradeoffs. Dendron started its life as a standalone app (eg. think Obsidian) but I quickly realized I was spending most of my time building undifferentiated editor scaffolding instead of focusing on the hierarchies and schemas that made Dendron unique.\n\nI wanted to spend more time building out features that supported Dendron's [hiearchy first approach](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html) to note taking which is what led me to re-write it for VSCode. \n\nThat being said, the core dendron engine is not vscode specific and there are folks that are experimenting with porting it over to other editors (eg. sublime, vim). We also have plans for a standalone editor in the future (most likely, this will be a fork of VSCode optimized for note taking)\n\n## Working with Notes\n\n### Why markdown?\n\nMarkdown lets you write text in a simple human readable notation that is platform independent. You don't need to have microsoft word to read a markdown file and now a days, all new note taking tools support importing and displaying markdown.\n\nFor more context, you can see the original markdown declaration [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) \n\n### Can I use Dendron with existing notes?\n\nYou can use Dendron with existing repositories of markdown notes.\n\nOpen the `Command Bar` in vscode and use the `Dendron: Change Workspace` command. It will ask you for a folder path as input.\n\nDendron will create a `dendron.code-workspace` file in specified directory and then open the workspace (if a workspace file already exists, it will use that). It will also create a `root.md` file in that directory if it doesn't exist (currently this is part of the internal working of dendron).\n\nDendron **does not** delete or overwrite any files during the **Change Workspace** operation.\n\n### How do I save?\n\nDendron automatically saves when you change focus (switch tabs or applications). You can also manually save using `Cmd+S` or `Ctrl+S` depending on your operating system\n\n### How do I go back to the previous note?\n\nThere are 3 ways to go back to my previous note: \n\n1. `ctrl-tab` (go to previous tab)\n2. click on the previous tab\n3. using the open editors pane \n\n- NOTE: to have more than a single tab show, you need to have the following settings\n\n```json\n{\n    \"workbench.editor.enablePreview\": false,\n    \"workbench.editor.showTabs\": true\n}\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/faq.go-back.gif)\n\n## Working with Hierarchies\n\n### How should I name a note?\n\nThere are no rigid requirements on note naming in Dendron, other than the dots in the file name are used to construct the note [[note hierarchy|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]. However, the recommended way is to use all lowercase letters, replace spaces with `-`-mark and remove any special characters. Thus e.g. `John's amazing garage` becomes `johns-amazing-garage`.\n\nAlso, remember that you will use the note [[lookup-feature|dendron.topic.lookup]] to find notes quickly, and the lookup will use the names of the files. Thus try to name the files using the words that you are likely to use to find the note.\n\n### What kind of note hierarchy should I create?\n\nA good guideline is to start with a relatively flat hierarchy (even just a single note in the root!) and add topics as headings into those notes. When notes grow to the point that you have to start scrolling, it’s time to consider if it would be beneficial to split those notes. At that point, you probably already have some idea how the thoughts are placed in your mind - try to mimic that also with the hierarchy.\n\nIf you have a hard time deciding which ideas belong closer to root, think which of those ideas are more fundamental in your thinking. As an example, a note related to coding in Excel, should it be named as `code.excel` or `excel.code`? This could be resolved by thinking if you will write more about coding where Excel is just one example, or more about Excel, where coding is only one example. In case you think that both `excel.code` and `code.excel` are equal and both should be created, you could also make one of them a “master note” and [[refer|dendron.topic.refs]] to it from the other note.\n\n### Do I have to use hierarchies? What if I want to use another approach?\n\nDespite our emphasis on hierarchies, Dendron also supports non-hierarchal ways of organizing notes (eg. backlinks, zettelkasten, etc).\n\nYou can, and are encouraged to, combine these other workflows with Dendron hierarchies in order to create your own workflow that takes the best parts of each system!\n\n### What if I have a note that belongs in multiple hierarchies?\n\nThis comes up a lot especially when your dealing with organizing collections of things, like music or books. There are a few approaches we recommend here.\n\n1. Use [[tags|dendron.topic.tags]]. Tags work best with categorical data. If you use **Dendron Tags** (aka they're really hierarchies), then you have the added advantage of being able to refactor and track your tags using Dendron's existing hierarchal tooling. \n2. Use alias nodes. This is an [upcoming feature](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/128) that will allow you to put a node under multiple hierarchies. \n\n### Hierarchies add too much friction\n\nThe hierarchy adds friction but the idea is that the friction (eg. hierarchy) is not a bug but the reason why dendron works with thousands of notes. \n\nThe analogy to think about is excel: while putting your numbers inside the structure of a spreadsheet might not be the most straightforward way of getting to a numerical solution, its use becomes indispensable once you deal with a significant amount ofnumbers. \n\nThe way to think about dendron is that its not like google where you type a question and try to find an answer - until we get true AI, this simply doesn't work for personal knowledge. Rather, Dendron helps you organize your notes so you can reference the information you need to answer your own questions.\n\n## Working with Schemas\n\n### What is the deal with schemas? Do I need to use them?\n\nThe short answer is no, you don't **need** to use schemas. That being said, schemas can help you manage your notes, especially as you collect more of them.\n\nIf you're familiar with typescript - Dendron schemas are similar to the types offered by typescript. You can compile your typescript code into javascript even if the types don't match (subject to your tsconfig). Types help make your projects maintainable, especially as they grow.\n\nCurrently, Dendron will do is show you an indicator if your schema doesn't match. In the future, we'll have a strict mode where we will actually prevent you from creating notes that don't match your schema.\n\nSchemas at the end of the day help you construct consistent hierarchies for your notes. Consistent hierarchies alleviate the cognitive overhead of needing to understand and track N things where N can be very big. Instead, you can construct a single schema that encompasses the common areas of all N things.\n\nBut even if you don't have a lot of notes, schemas are helpful because they provide extra features [like templating](https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates) and [auto complete](https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#why-use-schemas).\n\n<!-- \nThis allows you to quickly reference anything within your hierarchy because they all have the same shape. It also helps with understanding a topic - I (Kevin, Dendron author) find my schema for a domain tends to reflect my mental model for said domain as well.\n\nFor example, I'm using nodejs and need to access a file. I have no idea what the builtin/recommended library for file access is. Instead of having to dig up [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra), I can navigate to `l.node.file` and see my notes on the best way to work with files. You can replace node with any other programming language. Now I have a general way of referencing file access for all languages without needing to remember the specific implementation detail of any of them.\n-->\n\n## Finding Notes\n\n### Can I do filter by the metadata in Dendron?\n\nMetadata is currently under utilized because we don't have a built in way of easily querying by it. We currently have [this issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/152) tracking the progress of advanced query work.\n\nIn the future, we want to support:\n\n- querying by custom frontmatter attributes: <https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/152>\n- query by attributes with logical operators: <https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/159>\n\nWe also want to support some subset of the queries as note references so that the results can be included in page.\n\n## Other\n\n### Why are there `root` files in my notes?\n\nWhen you initialize a vault, `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` get created inside each vault.\n\nThey serve as the \"roots\" of your vault for your notes and schema respectively.\n\nroot.md is used as the parent of all hierarchies, root.schema as the parent of all schemas\n\nroot.md is what shows up when you do a lookup with an empty line \"\"\n\nroot.schema.yml is a schema that is global for all hierarchies (normally, a schema is scoped to a particular hierarchy)\n\nNow this isn't required per-say, we could just do away with **root** notes and stick strictly to hierarchies and this might be an option in the future but this is the reasoning at the current time\n\nps. root.schema.yml doesn't work right now as described in the sense that we haven't implemented global schemas yet\n\n### Can I use a dark theme for the markdown preview?\n\nYes. There's a setting called `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewTheme` that you can set which has a list of default themes, including dark themes. \n\n### Can I customize the markdown preview CSS?\n\nYes. Read [this](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/customize-css) for more information.\n\n### Is there a list of keyboard shortcuts I can see?\n\nDendron has a list of keyboard shortcuts that you can access using `Dendron: Show Help` command. Note that these only show the commands that come with the Dendron Plugin but not its bundled extensions. We currently have an open [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/148) to list all shortcuts on one page. \n\n### Why are there '+' signs next to the notes in the Tree View?\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/faq.plus-sign.jpg)\n\nThe reason you see this is because Dendron will create [[stub|dendron.concepts#stubs]] notes when creating notes that have parents that don't exist. These notes are placeholders and will only be visible in the Dendron Tree View with a `+` sign next to the name. The reason we do stubs is because we don't want to litter your file system with empty files. Stubs are a compromise - they let you see the hierarchy of your newly created notes without forcing you to create intermediary files.\n\n### Why custom markdown preview instead of the VSC one?\n\nOur custom markdown preview gives us much more functionality then the vscode one -> eg. note references, checkboxes, etc.\n\nIn addition, the markdown preview that Dendron uses is platform agnostic (eg. it's also available on atom). This means that other editors could potentially adopt it as well.\n\n### VSCode Snippets are not working in Frontmatter\n\nThe default snippets are scoped to markdown. You can create [global snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets) file to have snippets that work across all languages.\n\n\n### The extension 'Dendron Markdown Preview Enhanced' took a very long time to complete its last operation \n\nThis is a known issue whenever we release a new version of the preview (mostly because its uncompressed javascript).  Moving forward, we'll be removing the dependency on an external plugin and integrating Dendron's markdown features into vscode's native markdown preview in the near future. \n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html","relUrl":"notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html"},{"doc":"Development","title":"Development","hpath":"dendron.dev","content":"If you would like to contribute to the development of dendron, you can do so by checkout out the [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) from github.\n\nYou can then follow the setup instructions below to prepare your first commit!\n\n((ref:[[dendron.dev.setup]]#getting started))\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/3489b652-cd0e-4ac8-a734-08094dc043eb.html","relUrl":"notes/3489b652-cd0e-4ac8-a734-08094dc043eb.html"},{"doc":"Windows","title":"Windows","hpath":"dendron.dev.windows","content":"\nThe Dendron VSCode extension is built in TypeScript and uses a lot of JavaScript tooling to build and compile, and does not always play nice with Windows.\n\nHere are some of the things to look out for.\n\n## git\n\nMost of the Dendron developers use Mac or Linux, so the file endings and permissions are not the same.\nAfter you build Dendron, git will pick up a lot of file changes that don't actually exist [^diff].\n\nIn order to fix this (preferably do this before building Dendron):\n\n- Create a .gitattributes file in the root of the Dendron repo and add `* text=auto` [^lineendings]\n- run `git config --add core.filemode false` on the repo [^chmod]\n\nIf you are still seeing blank changes in git run:\n\n- `git add --renormalize .` [^diff] (yes there is a single dot at the end of the command.)\n\n## watch script\n\nDendron has a watch.sh script which will continuously compile all dependencies while you are developing.

Requirements\n\nBefore you begin, you need to make sure to have the following SDKs and tools:\n\n- [Node.js >= 12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)\n  - We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)\n\n### 2. Clone and npm install\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron.git\ncd dendron\nnpm install\n```\n\n### 3. Build Repo\n\n- you should run this when building dendron for the first time and also every time you run a git pull\n  - new dependencies might have been picked up between pulls and this makes sure that they are installed\n\n```bash\nyarn bootstrap:bootstrap\nyarn bootstrap:build \n```\n\n- we recommend you use `vscode` to develop for dendron. there is a `dendron.code-workspace` file in the root of the monorepo that you should use when developing\n\n### 4. Editing (the plugin)\n\nAt the root of the monorepo, open `dendron-main.code-workspace`. Open this with VSCode to start editing. While its not required to use VSCode, most of the helper scripts in this repository are created with VSCode in mind so using it will make development significantly easier.\n\n### 5. Start Debugging (the plugin)\n\n- NOTE: you don't need to do this if you are not directly working on the extension (eg. you're working on the [[server|dendron.pro.dendron-next-server]])\n\nTo start an instance of the Dendron with the Debugger, Run `Extension (plugin-core)` from the debug panel in vscode\n\n![debugger](/assets/images/start_debugger.gif)\n\n_Note: Running via Run -> Start Debugging will not work unless you've previously targeted `Extension (plugin-core)`_\n\n## Tips\n\n### Watch Monorepo\nTo continuously compile all dependencies, run the following\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap/scripts/watch.sh\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Something went wrong during the build\n\nIn case something something goes wrong with a build step or you want to save time by not running everything, `init.sh` is just a thin wrapper around the following scripts, each of which can be run individually\n\n- ./bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap.sh: `lerna bootstrap all packages`\n- ./bootstrap/scripts/build.sh: `lerna build all packages`\n\n### Changes not showing up in Dendron\n\n1. Are you using the `Run extension` command on the debugger panel to test dendron? \n\n2. If you have one vscode instance which you have dendron installed and are also doing dendron development on, you might get a version conflict. in that case, use `Run extension with plugin disabled` in the debugger panel (or use a different version of vscode to run dendron vs develop)\n\n## Testing\n\n- see [[Testing|dendron.dev.testing]]\n\n## Debugging\n\n- see [[Debugging|dendron.dev.debug]]\n\n## Style\n\n- see [[Style|dendron.dev.style]]\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html","relUrl":"notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html"},{"doc":"Ref","title":"Ref","hpath":"dendron.dev.ref","content":"\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/b5736273-85ad-4d0c-bb30-89c92a3941da.html","relUrl":"notes/b5736273-85ad-4d0c-bb30-89c92a3941da.html"},{"doc":"Vscode","title":"Vscode","hpath":"dendron.dev.ref.vscode","content":"\n## Tasks\n- [vscode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks)\n\n- workspace specific way of executing scripts\n\n\n## Debug Pane\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/dev.vscode-debug.jpg)","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/3307c16e-69d9-48cd-b1cc-1dfe88274191.html","relUrl":"notes/3307c16e-69d9-48cd-b1cc-1dfe88274191.html"},{"doc":"Kevins Setup","title":"Kevins Setup","hpath":"dendron.dev.ref.kevins-setup","content":"\n\nDendron has a lot of moving parts so I try to divide my workspace accordingly.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/dev.kevin.jpg)\n\n- 1: What I'm working on\n- 2 and 3: Related project (eg. if 1 was the plugin, 2 & 3 might be `engine-server` and `api-server` respectively)\n- 4 and 5: This is where I keep common utils/libs (eg. `common-all`, type definitions, etc)\n\nSince your screen space can be pretty small when doing this, I use the following keyboard shortcut to trigger maximizing panes\n\n```json\n{ \n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.toggleEditorWidths\",\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+cmd+m\"\n}\n```\n\nI also try to document the main logic when I run into it in the {project}.internals hierarchy on our site: https://dendron.so/notes/4b8f0470-dacb-433b-8d0c-f5a7d8f5245d.html","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/10e86d42-e3e3-4aae-92ad-c086b776f34e.html","relUrl":"notes/10e86d42-e3e3-4aae-92ad-c086b776f34e.html"},{"doc":"Extension","title":"Extension","hpath":"dendron.dev.ref.lifecylce","content":"- not_initialized\n  - tried starting workspace but something went wrong\n- initialized\n  - reloadWorkspace complete\n  - **upgraded**\n  - upgrade workspace complete\n- upgraded (optional)\n  - extension has upgraded\n- activate\n  - finish showWelcome\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/5e164216-c464-4a6f-ae85-a6f5cbc787e7.html","relUrl":"notes/5e164216-c464-4a6f-ae85-a6f5cbc787e7.html"},{"doc":"Issues","title":"Issues","hpath":"dendron.dev.issues","content":"### gyp issue when installing\n\n- Call to 'krb5-config gssapi --libs' returned exit status 127 while in binding.gyp. while trying to load binding.gyp\n\n```bash\nyum install make glibc-devel gcc patch\n```\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/af2ba46a-4dbc-4648-9d4c-f6d6d2e3bb50.html","relUrl":"notes/af2ba46a-4dbc-4648-9d4c-f6d6d2e3bb50.html"},{"doc":"Design","title":"Design","hpath":"dendron.dev.design","content":"## Overview\n\nDendron is composed of three main components and a collection of complementing libraries.\n\nBelow is a sketch of the General Architecture\n```\n|Dendron Plugin| (vscode) <-> |API Server <-> Dendron Engine| (local express server)\n```\n## Major Components\n\n### Dendron Plugin\n- name: @dendronhq/plugin-core\n- [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/tree/master/packages/plugin-core)\n\nThis is the Dendron VSCode extension\n\n### Dendron Engine\n- name: @dendronhq/engine-server\n- [repo](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/tree/master/packages/engine-server)\n\nThis is responsible for Dendron's hierarchal index and lookup capabilities.

file structure looks like any other part of the file system. Less to learn, faster to adopt\n- you can place any files (e.g. pdfs, xlsx or draw.io diagrams) into the folders without renaming them (and reference them with the same mechanics)\n- easier to save files into the right place of the structure without the assistance of vscode (e.g. normal drag-and-drop works)\n- natural \"zoom\" functionality into the structure (just open the folder)\n- filenames look cleaner in vscode (in several views, like explorer, file tabs, git etc) as well as in normal OS utilities\n- large amount of files in the same folder makes normal file system tools less useful (OS file explorer, commands like ls or tree, potential choking of operations)\n- less implementation needed for dendron (e.g. no need for dendron tree view since normal file explorer works)\n- other vscode extensions rely on file structures for cleaner views (e.g. TODO tree). Not all views can be re-implemented for dendron\n- normal file system permissions could be used to limit visibility to certain sub-hierarchies\n- various sub-parts of the hierarchy can be brought into the same workspace via symlinks\n- Is compliant with enterprise setting, many companies just wouldn't adopt dot-based hierarcies for their knowledge-base (it's \"too weird\", \"unproven\" etc.)\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/da241d31-8a05-429c-a041-02ac6170bf20.html","relUrl":"notes/da241d31-8a05-429c-a041-02ac6170bf20.html"},{"doc":"Summary","title":"Summary","hpath":"dendron.dev.design.engine","content":"These documents are a high level overview of the code inside Dendron. They are written in a type script like pseudo code. The code blocks are broken down into the following structure:\n\n```\n# {Function}  --> what is happening\n## Summary    --> high level function call of what is happening\n## Flows      --> pseudo code describing high level functions\n\n### {Flow Entry}\n\n- loc: ... --> where code is located. {package}/{basename}\n- desc: ... --> description \n```\n\n## Pseudo Code\n\nThe code description is typescript-ish. The goal isn't to write valid typescript but be a **summarized** version of the code. The syntax is evolving but here is a loosely documented starting point:\n\n- @: equivalent of `this.`\n- $: referencing a global variable\n- `...`: code that is omitted because it would clutter the summary\n- `=:` magic equality, \n\nThe places where you see this convention being broken (eg. actual valid typescript) are areas where the author got lazy and just copied code into the summary. Try to not do this because that defeats the point of a _summarized_ view. That being said, Dendron is all about being pragmatic and taking an iterative approach to things. \n\n# Initializing the Engine\n\n## Summary\n\n- engine.query\n  - store.query\n    - FileParser.parse\n      ```ts\n      allFiles {\n        getFileMeta\n        toNode\n      }\n      ```\n    -

Instead, use the following command:\n\n```\nlerna add {package-to-install} --scope @dendronhq/{package-to-install-into}\n```\n\nBecause this is typescript, don't forget to also install the `@types` package if it exists\n\n```bash\nlerna add @types/{package-to-install} --scope @dendronhq/{package-to-install-into}\n```\n\n### Add a new node package\n\n- initialize repo\n\n```bash\ncd {workspace_dir}\ncp -R /path/to/dendron-yeoman/node-ts packages/{new-package}\n```\n\n- update `package.json`\n\n  - change project name\n\n- publish the repo (needs to be done initially before running lerna publish)\n\n```\nnpm publish --access public\n```\n\n### Using eslint\n\nAll packages in the repo use a standard base configuration found at [.eslintrc.js](.eslintrc.js). If you're using the VS Code and would like to see eslint violations on it, install the [eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).\n\n### Add a new site config option\n\nThe following is an example of controlling formatting options to the DendronSiteConfig. You can see the [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/278) for more details.\n\nDendron currently will auto-format notes during `Rename` and `Refactor` operations when links inside a note need to be replaced.\n\nThe formatting options are defined [here](https://dendron.so/notes/849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4.html#renaming-a-note).\n\nThese are [rough notes](https://dendron.so/notes/849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4.html#flow) of how formatting gets called during rename\n\nTo make this customizable, the following changes need to be made:\n\n- [ ] update the [DendronConfig type definition](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types.ts#L405:L405)\n- [ ] update [config defaults](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/config.ts#L42:L42)\n- [ ] pass in formatting options from the [plugin](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/RenameNoteV2a.ts#L137:L137)\n- [ ] accept formatting args in the [server](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/api-server/src/routes/note.ts#L38:L38)\n- [ ] accept formatting args in the [engine](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/enginev2.ts#L249:L249)\n- [ ] accept it when [replacing links](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/topics/markdown/utilsv2.ts#L85:L85)\n- [ ] accept it in [remark pipeline](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/topics/markdown/utilsv2.ts#L41:L41)\n\nWhen all this is done, we can add tests that the formatting behavior works\n\n- [ ] [engine tests](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/__tests__/enginev2.spec.ts#L652:L652)\n- [ ] [plugin test](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/suite-integ/RenameNoteV2.test.ts#L157:L157)\n\nThe above changes are for `Rename`. `Refactor` calls rename in a loop so changing rename should update refactor as well.\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/a80f36d9-01d0-4c5a-a228-867b093a4913.html","relUrl":"notes/a80f36d9-01d0-4c5a-a228-867b093a4913.html"},{"doc":"API","title":"API","hpath":"dendron.dev.api","content":"\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/348fc5c7-e1ba-4fa2-ab6d-a3c94628fa11.html","relUrl":"notes/348fc5c7-e1ba-4fa2-ab6d-a3c94628fa11.html"},{"doc":"Seeds","title":"Seeds","hpath":"dendron.dev.api.seeds","content":"((ref:[[dendron.topic.seeds]]#seeds 🚧,1:#*))\n\n# DendronSeed\n\nBase class to extend from when creating a new seed.

Note that features with 🚧 are still under active development and might not be fully implemented.\n\n### Markdown\n\nDendron supports markdown, a popular markup syntax that is like HTML but 1000x simpler. If you are new to markdown, you can read about the syntax [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).\n\n### Frontmatter\n\nFrontmatter is a convenient way of adding extra information to your documents like a shorthand title or longer description (think any extra information you can use to describe a note). This type of information is generally called metadata and the structure used is called [YAML](https://yaml.org/). You can add it to the front of your markdown file and it won't show up in the preview. It was first introduced by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). \n\nYou can read more about the frontmatter used in Dendron [[here |dendron.topic.frontmatter]]\n\n### Workspace\nIn Dendron, your **workspace** is the root of where all your files are located. It's set when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`. The folder that contains your workspace is also known as your **workspace root**.\n\n### Vaults \nYour workspace is made up of **vaults**. A dendron vault stores a collection of related notes. If you're familiar with git, it's just like a code repo. By default, Dendron creates a *vaults* folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── vault.main\n    │   ├── foo.md\n    │   ├── foo.one.md\n    │   └── foo.two.md\n    └── vault.secret (hypothetical)\n        ├── secret.one.md\n        └── secret.two.md\n```\n\nBy default, when you look for notes in Dendron, it will search over all vaults.\n\nA vault can be one of two types: \n- local \n- remote\n\n#### Local Vault\n\nA local vault is what you start off with. Its a vault that is local to your file system.\n\n#### Remote Vault\n\nA remote vault is what you get when you run the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] command and select a remote vault. This is a vault that is cloned from a git repo. \n\n<!-- \n### Workspace Configuration\nWorkspace configuration is located directly underneath the **workspace root**.  By convention, the default configuration is going to be in a folder titled **config**. This is also called the **configuration root**. A workspace can have multiple configurations that initializes your workspace with a different subset of vaults.\n-->\n\n### Hierarchies\n\n((ref:[[dendron.topic.hierarchies]]#Hierarchies,1:#Concepts))\n\nYou can read more about hierarchies [[here|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]\n\n### Domain\n\nA domain is the root of a hierarchy. In the example below, `project1` would be the domain.\n\n\n```\n.\n├── project1.md\n├── project1.designs.md\n├── project1.designs.promotion.md\n├── project1.paperwork.md\n├── project1.paperwork.legal.md\n├── project1.tasks.md\n├── project1.tasks.task1.md\n└── project1.tasks.task2.md\n```\n\n### Schema  \n\nAs you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. \n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace. \n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n  children cmd\n    - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  namespace: true\n```\n\n### Stubs\n\nStubs are notes that don't exist but that you might want to create. They will show up as suggestions in lookup results.\nThere are two reasons why these suggested notes might show up: \n- they are the uncreated parent of a note deeper in the hierarchy (eg. `foo.bar` might be a stub for `foo.bar.foobar`)\n- they are possible notes according to the schema\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n> The `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note is a stub and does not exist \n\n### Pods \n\n[[Pods |dendron.topic.pod]] are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. \n\n\n### Command Bar\n\nThe command bar is native to `vscode`. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with `Dendron:`. You can use the following shortcut to open the command bar. \n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n- <img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `Cmd+Shift+P`\n- <img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n\n\n### Lookup Bar\n\nThe lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. You can type `> Dendron: Lookup` in the `Command Bar` or use the `Ctrl+L` shortcut. \n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+L`\n- <img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `Cmd+L`\n- <img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+L`\n\n![](assets/2020-07-07-20-14-57.png)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html","relUrl":"notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html"},{"doc":"Community","title":"Community","hpath":"dendron.community","content":"Dendron wouldn't be what it is today without its wonderful users.\n\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/6f4cd441-f883-4e75-871b-b7f93895c91b.html","relUrl":"notes/6f4cd441-f883-4e75-871b-b7f93895c91b.html"},{"doc":"Showcase","title":"Showcase","hpath":"dendron.community.showcase","content":"Below are examples of published Dendron vaults\n\n## Official\n\n### Dendron homepage\n\n- homepage: <https://dendron.so>\n  ![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-09-05-45.png)\n\n### Open PKM Catalogue\n\n- homepage: <https://pkm.dendron.so>\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/showcase.pkm.jpg)\n\n### Open AWS Catalogue\n\n- homepage: <https://aws.dendron.so>\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/showcase.aws.jpg)\n\n## Members\n\n### Kevin's page\n\n- homepage: <https://kevinslin.com/>\n- discord: `@kevins8#0590`\n  ![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png)\n\n### Ed's Page\n\n- homepage: <https://ens100.github.io/>\n- discord: `@edns100#4851`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-09-04-36.png)\n\n### Jack's page\n\n- homepage: <https://imalightbulb.xyz>\n- discord: `@I'm a lightbulb#6986`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-09-01-48.png)\n\n### Luke's second brain\n\n- homepage: <https://luke.carrier.im/>\n- discord: `@lukecarrier#2081`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-27-20-50-54.png)\n\n### Ian's digital garden\n\n- homepage: <https://garden.ianjones.us/>\n- discord: `@ianjones#3696`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-12-06-09-43-31.png)\n\n### Kevin's digital garden (another one)\n\n- homepage: garden.kevincunningham.co.uk\n- discord: `@dolearning (Kevin)#3551`\n\n![ScreenShot of @dolearning digital garden](https://res.cloudinary.com/kc-cloud/image/upload/v1607614868/digital_garden_screenshot_j9wrcz.png)\n\n\n### Cameron's digital garden\n\n- homepage: <https://notes.serendipidata.com/>\n- discord: `@cameron#9185`\n\n![](https://p-qkfgo2.t2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/WnuBJ0L1/8befb6dd-740d-4088-bbeb-b5c21954e308.jpg?v=4e54f3d2ffbbe051c195eab04c72971f)\n","url":"https://dendron.so/notes/3a82c5ff-7945-46ae-8bf9-3b2275fc6642.html","relUrl":"notes/3a82c5ff-7945-46ae-8bf9-3b2275fc6642.html"},{"doc":"Roles","title":"Roles","hpath":"dendron.community.roles","content":"Dendron has special roles for members of its community. \n\n## Dendrologist\n\n**Dendrologist** are active members of the Dendron community.
